 How do the Norwich players feel at this point, Jerry? Excited, nervous? Absolutely loving it because the fans will be right behind them, that'll settle their nerves down. They all want first touches, give it to a yellow shirt and get in the game early on. Jamal Lewis up against Bernardo Silva looks... Wow, that looks a problem, that one does. Wicall Walker backing him up, that right-hand side. The game's started and Norwich City are playing the ball confidently away from the edge of their own penalty area. At the Barkley end, eventually Jamal Lewis's clearance is charged out, and Ben Godfrey does clear it towards the halfway line. Norwich in yellow and green, Manchester City all in black here, not in their usual sky blue coloured kit. But Norwich City enjoy plenty of the ball early on, albeit deep inside their own half, as they defend the Barkley end going from right to left as we look at it. And the ball goes back to Tim Crewe. And I'm sure Daniel Falk will be relieved, his experience absolutely vital today. He's played it long, it's a Campwell who can't quite control, and Manchester City can get a foot on the ball for the first time with their defender Nicholas Ottomendi. And back it goes to Ederson, the goalkeeper. A few questions about the Manchester City defence at the moment with La Porte, their best defender being ruled out, almost in a Norwich City style really. He's going to be missing for quite a few months, so the opportunity knocks for John Stones, the England defender who's been out of favour under Pep Guardiola recently, and he gets his chance today. The ball is sprayed to the right wing and Kyle Walker, we see him setting off for the first time. Campwell's got back and got the foot in, and that was important, but then Jamal Lewis fails to give the ball back to Campwell, and Manchester City have possession inside Norwich territory. Teddy, already you can see him waving, shouting, trying to organise that team in the midfield. He's the captain today. Stones for Manchester City on halfway, looking for Aguero who gets involved in the game for the first time, back on the halfway line, he's dropped deep to get involved. Norwich giving everybody back behind the ball in these early stages as you might expect. It's back on halfway with Ottomendi and now Stones, who enters the Norwich City half. Pukki goes to close him down. Aguero works the ball around the corner, Manchester City building a threatening attack here. They've got Raheem Sterling involved on the left-hand side in the penalty area. Comes back out to David Silva, who weaves his way past Teddy, tries across, Buendia gets the foot in, that's important, it's gone for a corner. Byram tried to keep the ball in play, actually that might not have been a very good idea because it was going to fall for Manchester City in an attacking area, but Byram hadn't managed to keep it in play. It will be a Man City corner and a test of concentration here, first set piece of the game. Definitely set of concentration, focus. Send Byram on Raheem Sterling, he's got to get very, very close to that player, we know what he can do, how dangerous he can be. So a corner, looks like Gundogan is going to go across the tape. The German international from the left-hand side, in front of the Barclay end for Manchester City, who imagine their first serious attack of the game, it's driven in towards the near post point, Buendia got a foot on it, headed down, and Krul is able to catch it gratefully. Buendia actually got there at the near post, but all he could do was help the ball on its way into the middle, and it was slightly awkward there, with a scrum of players in front of Krul, but nobody got a decent contact on it. It's going to be hard for Man City to get his head on the ball there, we had 11 players inside the 18-yard box, very determined Norwich now to keep compact. When they play, they look like they're getting wide, they're getting width, the playing were confident so far, so they've eased into this game nicely. The ball's gone back to Tim Krul, the Norwich goalkeeper, who clears his lines comfortably there. Bounces into the midfield now, and Steeperman collects for Norwich City. They use the ball well, Norwich City, when they have it, and they don't use the ball well there. Steeperman looking for Jamal Lewis, but it was a yard or two too far in front of him, and it's rolled out for a throw-in, and that's one thing they can't do today, I know it's obvious, but when you've got it, letting Manchester City have it back easily, you cannot do that very often, can you? Interesting to see whether Norwich would adapt a high-press game, they're obviously not doing so, they're getting compact and behind the ball, making Manchester City work, the spaces for them to be showing danger, but no, they cannot give the ball away. When they get it, Norwich have to keep it, and that's where the confidence comes from, maintaining possession, and we know how good they are, Norwich are keeping the ball, they've got to do it today. Almost a mistake by Artemendi at the back there, Steeperman sensed the chance to close him down, but Artemendi just got away from him in time, the ball is now played back to Edison, he's been closed down by Buendia, he's 25 yards from his own goal here, the Manchester City keeper, but he's comfortable in possession, he's given it to Zinchenko, it was just a split second where it looked like Buendia may steal the ball there, but we know how good Edison, the Brazilian goalkeeper, is on the ball, that very vivid neck tattoo that he's got is visible, written from all the way up here on the gantry in the south stand, nil-nil, Manchester City, as you would expect, enjoying the lion's share of the possession at Carra Rhodes, Zinchenko playing the ball out to the left-hand side, there's some space out there for Bernardo Silva, he's tried to work the ball into the penalty area, David Silva I should say, sorry, and it's come off a Norwich player, he's gone out for a throw into Manchester City, level with the Norwich penalty area, nil-nil, you can really sense the nerves around Carra Rhodes ahead of this one, of course there's excitement as well, but Norwich saw against Liverpool in the opening day of the season in that devastating first half, and Norwich actually didn't play that badly, but still found themselves 4-0 down, great noise inside Carra Rhodes, the fans certainly doing their bit, Otamendik coming forward from Manchester City, the ball played out to the left-hand side and Zinchenko, and then lovely bit of skill and a little return pass and Zinchenko's away on the left-hand side, Byron should make the challenge here though, after a heavy touch from Zinchenko, Byron does make the challenge, and wins a free kick as well in the right-back position, and there's applause for the former West Ham player, and that's the thing, it's a shame that Max Arons is missing because of injury, but Norwich knew they lacked cover in that position, they knew that might happen at some point in the season, and they got Byron in in the summer for just this sort of thing, so they are covering that position. I mean he did very very well there as well, he'll be feeling a lot better now, he's got his first tackle in, he's got the crowd cheering him, what's important down that right-hand side is that Bondier and Byron work together so closely and so well, they've got to go with runners, they've got to force the ball wide, then they've got to close to stop crosses coming in. More nil, Norwich want to throw it, halfway inside the Manchester City half, and even that is being applauded by the supporters at the moment. Steeperman gets a touch, Manchester go past one man City player, but then the ball is hit back rather fiercely to goalkeeper Edison, who just nonchalantly sticks a foot out and controls it, and passes it out to Kyle Walker, and here we go with Walker charging forward on this right-hand side, he's so quick, but surprisingly left out of the last England squad, so he's had the international break off, and he will be fresh. Here's Gundogan in the midfield, rolling the ball to Zinchenko now, Sterling out on the left-hand side hugging the touchline, level with the Norwich penalty area, beginning to cut inside, Bondier makes a challenge, a feel for a handball there by Manchester City against Bondier, and that's not been given, but it will be a Man City throw in, and they look to keep the tempo up, six and a half minutes gone, goalless at Carrarote, here's Rodri in the midfield, Spanish signing from the summer, kicking Fernandinho out of the team at the moment, so he can't be bad can he, and the ball goes to Bernardo Silva on the right-hand side, the Portuguese who's tricking Jamal Lewis here, bringing Kyle Walker into play, Gundogan now will work the ball in field to John Sturms, Zinchenko who is the left back, but he's seeing a lot of the ball in a sort of midfield area at the moment, here's Rodrik from Manchester City wide to the right, and Kyle Walker is well forward here, Cantwell goes to close him down, the ball played to Gundogan, and now Zinchenko again who's in a very very central position, and that's a dreadful ball from him out to the left-hand side, which was meant for Raheem Sterling, but he wasn't there, it's a deliberate play isn't it Zinchenko, whenever the ball is on the right-hand side from Manchester City, he's the left back, but he almost sits in the midfield. It's brilliant how they rotate all the persons that are playing today in their normal positions, they'll move inside, they'll move outside, they'll rotate nicely, they're versatile, so even Aguero, Aguero you can see he's frustrated and won't get a touch, so he's come 30 yards off to pick the ball up, anyway here we go. Clever stuff from Norwich City, Godfrey and McLean playing one touch stuff on the edge of their own box, and eventually then releasing Jamal Lewis up the field, who gets to the halfway line and then thinks better of it, the ball ricochets kindly for McLean, back to Jamal Lewis on the left, I mean in most games from there you would see him take the ball further on, but there seems to be a deliberate ploy here, and you can understand it, the Norwich call backs just to sit a little bit tighter than they usually do. Amadou playing the ball across to Godfrey, across the edge of his own area, now Jamal Lewis just helps the ball along the left-hand side, Steeperman makes it here, and he's knocked the ball past Kyle Walker, again played it early towards Puky, but it's beyond the finished striker and off to Mendy sweeps up, and Norwich didn't quite have a chance there, but just getting up towards the edge of the Man City penalty area drew ooze and arse from the supporters, because when you've got Puky in the team, the Premier League can't know that if anything drops to him, Norwich have got a chance for that. Well we had some space down the left-hand side, utilised that well, ball broke, put it to Puky, unfortunately couldn't get on the end of that one, but Norwich I don't think we mentioned Jamal Lewis there, that was another bad tackle. Yeah well Steeperman went in hard on Rodri, and it looked like a free kick, and it was a free kick to Manchester City, but after the decision had been made, Cantwell had committed himself to the challenge, and he was caught by the Man City player, he's going to be all right I think, Cantwell, you worry every time a Norwich player hits the deck that it's going to be another injury, but free kick to Manchester City, it's been taken, nearly nine minutes gone, 0-0 on BBC Radio Norfolk, the champions for the last two years, Manchester City coming forward with John Stones, unchallenged, halfway inside the Norwich half, lazy it out to the left-hand side, Tchenchenko plays it on, there's Sam Byron, first Premier League start for Norwich City to clear the ball away, but Norwich are so deep it's easy for Man City to collect on halfway. Walker in the centre circle, sprints the right, to the right-hand side, he's picked up, one of the Man City fans about three rows back, and relief from the Norwich fans as that pass goes astray, definite change of tactics from Norwich today, and you can understand it, it's partly the results they've had in the first part of the season and how open they've been, it's partly the fact they're playing Manchester City, and partly the personnel they've got, you can see why Norwich are being a little bit more cautious today, can't you? They've been a bit hesitant going forward and I think naturally so, with the team that's out there today, I'm sure Daniel Farker has just given a strong instruction for the first 10-15 minutes to whether any storm that's going to come their way firstly before they start getting on the ball and looking forward, and they're showing everybody why, Chris, everyone who's on the ball, they're getting compact in the middle, pushing Man City to use the wide areas where they can. Here's John Stones, Manchester City, an England defender, brings it up towards the halfway line, Norwich are good slow to closing down, he's got time to hang the ball out towards the left wing, and he's picked out the chest of Raheem Sterling, who brings it under control beautifully, exchanges passes with David Silva, comes down to Rodri, and then Tynchenko plays the ball back to the halfway line, and Ottomendi, and the ball is now played to Kyle Walker, his last pass went out for a throw-in, that's a better one from him, to the feet of Bernardo Silva, back to Kyle Walker, he's coming in towards the penalty area here, but the man City move breaks down, a loose pass from David Silva, and Norwich are able to steal possession back, and with Ben Godfrey, they're able to play their way out of trouble. Kamal Lewis, the left back, to McLean, he's further wide still, plays it onto Campwell, lovely football from Norwich here, inside their own half, and now Steeperman releases Campwell, this is great stuff from Norwich, Campwell up towards the halfway line though, and Rodri is there, puts his body in the way, and Campwell will not get past him, but Norwich almost playing Man City at their own game briefly there, we won't get too carried away. Well played everybody, I think you can give the opposition too much respect, especially Manchester City, they come here with such a reputation that you can actually feel the hesitancy from the Norwich City players, but in that smooth group of players there on the right hand side, they were keeping it, playing two touch, passing into a yellow shirt, they'll gain confidence from this Chris. Ottomendi brings the ball into the Norwich half, finds Zinchenko on the left hand side, you can see Pep Guardiola, another grey or beige jumper over on that far side, animated, shouting, there's Stones, playing the ball up to Aguero, Tessy gets the foot in, but the ball's rebounded back for Sergio Aguero, now it's Sterling in the Norwich City penalty area, pulls the trigger, blocked by Byron, and out for a throw into Manchester City, Byron just did enough there, got tight to Sterling in time to block the shot, and it remains goalless on BBC Radio Norfolk. Norwich are going to have to get through an awful lot of hard work today, Tetti gives the ball away, on the edge of his own penalty area, here's David Silva playing the ball back to Rodri, now the ball played towards the right hand side, a little bit of a loose pass, but Norwich were sitting so deep, Kyle Walker is able to catch up with the ball here, and then just angle it back towards the halfway line, and Stones, and Norwich, we don't see this very often from Norwich, every player behind the ball, bottom ending, coming forward, halfway inside the Norwich half, a flight to the left hand side in Zinchenko, on now to Sterling, he's very wide on that left hand side, back again to Zinchenko, and here's Rodri, Steeperman goes to meet him, wins the challenge, but Rodri has made a strong stuff, and even after losing a challenge, he somehow emerges back with the ball at his feet, two or three times, he's done that already in this game, Rodri, red hot air balloon just making its way over the city centre of Norwich at the moment, that we can see, the lengths people will go to to try and get a view of this game, here's Bernardo Silva on the right hand side to Kyle Walker, Bernardo Silva once more, Gundogan outside it, on the right wing, coming in field now, and scooping the ball to Rodri in the centre circle, now it's onto Zinchenko, Sterling's made a run on that left hand side, he looks frustrated, is in Zinchenko, ops, not to find him, instead they've got it forward to Gundogan, edge of the penalty area, lays it off to Aguero, but he's back to goal, back to Kyle Walker now, option outside him, in the shape of Bernardo Silva, he's going to test Jamal Lewis here, Bernardo Silva, curling the ball across, and a cross shot really, it's gone behind for a goal kick, yeah, worth telling you I think that Bernardo Silva, as Manchester City's player of the year last season, and when you're winning that award, in the company that they've got, that's worth remarking on isn't it, that's something to be very proud of. He's a terrific player, but they all are, and when you look around the team they're terrific, but I think Norris can be really pleased with where they started this particular game, they're keeping Manchester City very quiet, the pace of the game is slow, they don't even have to work hard to prevent trouble coming their way, they're just shadow play, they push them wide all the time, when it goes wide it comes back in and goes back to the centre halves, Norris should be pleased so far. They can see the pitch from that hot air balloon, or do you think it's too far away up there? Probably too far away isn't it? I think they've got a view there with binoculars. It's going out sort of over towards the north of the city now. It's going to be Jamal Lewis who will play the ball long, lovely header on from Pukki, gathered by Steeperman in the centre circle, and now played into the path of Buendia, who's up towards the edge of the Manchester City penalty area, challenged by Sterling, Buendia from on the ground plays it to Byron, and the attack keeps going, and here's Steeperman looking for the ball into the area, cut out by Rodri, he is cutting an impressive figure in the early part of this game, Norwich can't find a way past him at the moment, and it's switched to the right hand side of Bernardo Silva. But I think there's opportunities there, we just saw it once again for the second or third time, in that transition between defending, parking a bus at the 18-yard box, as they say, to that counter-attack in play, there are opportunities, and we saw on the right hand side, we've seen it on the left once, I think if Norwich are a little bit more confident, a little bit more assertive and aggressive, they can open up this back four for Manchester City. Quarter an hour gone, 0-0, but here come Manchester City, and it's David Silva, edge of the penalty area, lays the ball off under pressure from Amadou, and Norwich get there, and now Cantwell brings the ball up towards the halfway line, Cantwell scrapping and battling, losing possession, and then a rash challenge, he doesn't make any contact with Walker, but the pass has already got away by Manchester City, and it's Gundogan onto Zinchenko, low towards the edge of the penalty area, helped on by Aguero here, David Silva wide to the left of goal, place it back towards Aguero, who tried to chest it into the path of Sterling, but Norwich will get it away through Buendia, who rides a couple of challenges inside his own half, and is allowed to continue, and then play extensively into the path of Jamal Lewis on the left hand side. Norwich growing into this game, 0-0, here's Buendia on halfway, Buendia looks for Marco Stieperman, the tall German rolls it to the left hand side, and Jamal Lewis, and the Norwich passes are beginning to find their targets, Lewis coming forward for the first time in the game on the left hand side, then retreating with the ball still at his feet, oh the ball's gone under the foot of Kenny McLean, but he retrieves it and finds Buendia, Cantwell, thumps the challenge back, the pass back, it takes a couple of deflections, and eventually falls kindly for Norwich City, and it's Ben Godfrey who will look to spread the play out towards the right hand side, and Byrom, an ambitious ball, Byrom does really well to keep that ball in play going back towards his own half, and Norwich fans appreciating what their players are giving this at the moment, Amadou, it's been two minds here, as he goes up towards the halfway line and decides safety first, goes all the way back to Tim Craw. We'll know. I don't know how much time you spend as Daniel Farquhar as any manager before a Manchester City game talking about how you're going to attack them, you probably spend a disproportionate amount of time worrying about yourself defensively don't you? I think it's overloaded in this this game so far Chris, because the defence are doing very well, collectively as a team you're defending well, we're keeping them at bay, they haven't really caused us any trouble, Aguero was terrific in that one incident, but recovered, we survived that particular attack, and then we counter-attack, but I just think they need to get hold of this game a little bit more, be more confident in their own ability to take on Man City and drive forward with the ball. Manchester City's last two Premier League visits to Carrow Road have both ended 0-0, you'd have got very good odds on that being the score today, but it is at the moment, 17 minutes here's Buendía for Norwich City, out to the left-hand side, Jamal Lewis has it, and he has space to work with here, and he will use that space, and he's up towards the corner of the penalty area, back it goes to Kenny McLean, on to Buendía, a long way out here Buendía, pushes it into the path of Teddy who's come roaring forward, on the right-hand side drills a low cross in, it's off the shins of Zinchenko, and behind for a Norwich City corner, it's that sort of evening where even winning a corner gets the crowd going, and Stieperman is now warring his arms around and trying to get the river end singing and making some noise, it looks like a cup tie this. This is what we should be having from the first whistle, the crowd getting behind the players and not being fearful of the man sitting side but driving at them like they just did there, well done Teddy. Corner, Buendía from the right-hand side delivers, McLean's head on, and he's in, Ferris getting taken the lead against the champions, Kenny McLean rising at the near post to head the corner firmly beyond Ellison, Carrow Road is going crazy here, there's a long time left in the match but that is some moment, Norwich City are in front against Moch as the City and it's a Kenny McLean header, what an L at Carrow Road. What a goal, great delivery from the corner, great run into the box, and a two-ripple finish, now that's what you can see, now that's what you can do, you've got to believe in yourself when you go out there and play these tough teams and I think they have been holding back and holding back defensively and maybe naturally so but when you've got space in front of you and you exploit that space and you take the game on, you drive forward against the man sitting side, they become hesitant and they get them in that box from that corner, what a great goal, what a great start from Norwich. Well he's already the mayor of Norwich, if they see this one out, goodness knows what he'll be up tonight but that was a lovely header and go back to what we said a moment ago, we've got the cut tie atmosphere, how often in these sort of games, when you're the underdog, does a set piece make the difference and that's Norwich's first corner and they've scored from it. Listen we're going to dominate this game, just be careful of the set pieces and they weren't, they had about 10 players in the box and still we got forward and still we scored. And actually, if Norwich had conceded that goal, we'd be furious wouldn't they, a player like Kenny McClain getting a header in but anyway here come Manchester City, big few moments ahead for Norwich now as they try to hold on to this lead and Buendia have set up the goal, has found Campwell here, deep inside his own half, Campwell turns the ball forward, Puky just about holds it in but has given it away in doing so to David Silva and now Sterling is halfway inside the Norwich half, back to Rodri, out to the left hand side it will go and Zinchenko looking for the run of Sterling, back out to Zinchenko on that left wing, there's a crossing opportunity here, Zinchenko takes a touch, now delivers and there's Amadou on his Carowroad debut to head the ball away and then Campwell is battling here with Rodri, the Spanish player has eventually got the ball forward, it rolls under the foot of Kyle Walker but he got enough on it to eventually bring it under control and then curl the ball in from the right, Ben Godfrey's there to head it away, it'll drop to Sterling on the edge of the penalty area, Sterling getting into a central position, shooting and the ball flies wide and there's no deflection but there are oohs and ahs from the Carowroad crowd out of relief. Norwich are winning this game, they lead Manchester City 1-0 and it just feels like a really big 5-10 minutes now doesn't it Gossie, just do not keep this 1-0 for as long as you can. I think it needed, I think the crowd have played a big part in us taking the lead, well done Amadou, he really attacked that ball that went up in the air in the 18-yard box and that's what it means, it'll need a leader at the back there to dictate and clear the ball when needed but also dictate and pull people around him to be organised to stop Man City coming through the middle, push the ball wide all the time. Norwich City's last two Carrowroad goals against Manchester City both scored by Russell Martyr so it's something about Scottish internationals in this fixture, that's a game that finished 4-3 you might remember a few years ago under Chris Hughton, Boundeer has just been penalised, just a bit eager there going in for the challenge on Sterling and it's a free kick to Manchester City inside their own half. Norwich lead 1-0 here against Manchester City, if you are just joining us that's what's happened, Kenny McLean a header from a corner, I mean you look at Norwich's threats from corners and you think about Amadou and Godfrey, Pukki of course as well but McLean arriving there and a wonderful header beyond Edison and the Canaries are in front, here's Sterling tickled well there by Byron who's managed to see him back towards the halfway line, John Stoves from the Everton now rolls it to Kyle Walker, we've got Bernardo Silva out here on the right hand side the near side as they attack the Barclay ends, now Gwendoan proving difficult to shake off the ball but at least Norwich have forced Manchester City back into their own half with Stoves here's Zinchenko the Ukrainian international who's never lost a Premier League game, plays the ball out to the left wing, here's Raheem Sterling level with the Norwich penalty area here Sterling goes past Buendia, Sterling now looking for the run of David Silva, Byron gets the block in and having scored from a corner, a moment to go, Norwich City must now defend the corner, Byron doing a good job on Raheem Sterling so far, got to stay compact now, Pruel's got to organise his defence, organise that six yard box Gwendoan goes out to take this corner again, former teammate of Moritz Leitner, he's Borussia Dortmund days Gwendoan's certainly fit and on the set pieces for Manchester City, about to deliver this corner into the penalty area from the left, into the Norwich area it goes, Krul has got a fist on that and it's fallen for Buendia who brings it away and then can't quite release Pukin, in fact the ball is ricocheted kindly here for David Silva in a good position, McLean worked so hard to get the ball off him though and then launch it long, ah Puky can't quite latch onto it on halfway but for a moment there I think Buendia's eyes lit up because from the initial clearance there was a chance to get Puky away and he didn't quite take it, Manchester City come again, Tchenko on that left hand side, infield to Jon Stokes, Stokes just 30 yards from goal, Aguero with an eke touch to David Silva on the edge of the penalty area into the path of Raheem Sterling from the left, the block gets in and McLean has cleared it away with a little bit of help from Amadou up towards the halfway line, Norwich are sitting deep, allowing the ball to be taken away, allowing Manchester City to gather the ball again and mount another attack, Bernardo Silva right hand side, Rodri behind it, Rodri gets the ball across it, it's in Tchenko, it's a good 35-40 yards from goal onto David Silva who's come looking for it, here's Rodri under pressure from Teti but he's got the ball back towards the halfway line in Otamendi now Jon Stokes, good ball into the path of Bernardo Silva on the right wing, comes skipping into the penalty area Jamal Lewis goes to meet him, they've got the ball back here to Kyle Walker, Walker across to Tchenko who's 25 yards out Sterling on the left corner of the penalty area, tackle by Byram again on Raheem Sterling and the ball runs away would have run away from Manchester City throw in but Tchenko's decided to keep it in, here's Aguero who's dropped deep to get involved and he finds David Silva on the edge of the area, out to the left it goes, opportunity for Sterling to swing the cross in and Tim Kool captures it 24 minutes gone, Norwich City 1-0 Manchester City Norwich fans, you must have dreamed of this sort of situation Gossie Even before the game started I was across on the riverside talking to the fans doing what we do in a pre-match build-up and everyone's saying we're going to be lucky to keep them down to four or five or six, it was never going to be the case Norwich are really doing their job well, every player is getting really close to the Man City team and that is exactly how you stop good players from playing, you get close, touch tight, stop them playing Ederson, the Manchester City goalkeeper, passes the ball out I mean he's not made a save yet is he, Ederson he's just had to pick the ball out of the back of his neck from the head of Kenny McLean Ederson's playing like a centre half, he must be about 30 yards outside his own box Here comes Kyle Walker on the attack from Manchester City, taking on Jamal Lewis, getting the cross in and it's cool he cuts it out at the near post, Aguero starting for the first time to look a little bit frustrated in that six yard box but the ball's into him but we've been not particularly accurate so far, Amadou and Godfrey have kept Aguero quiet so far but I'll underline so far in red pen because we've only played 25 minutes and oh that's water, back heel from Cantwell and he gets it back again from Stieperman A showboating now Norwich City, Cantwell brings it forward on the left-hand side, it was a wonderful bit of play from the new England under 21 international, Stieperman's being closed down, man on yells the Carrero crowd he finds Cantwell, Cantwell goes down, no foul says the referee and Manchester City are allowed to break forward because of that with Stoes who then is fouled by Eme Grandilla according to referee Kevin Friend now from here and I promise this isn't Norwich bias but from here those two challenges looked pretty similar to me Yeah they were the same challenges so if one was a foul the other one was it ended up Man City's way but well done to Cantwell, he showed his skill there didn't he really clever turn coming forward he certainly did, here's David Silva 25 yards out to Stirling on the left-hand side Manchester City searching for a Carreroad equaliser, Zinchenko puts the ball into the penalty area, two Norwich players go for it and they do enough and Teti completes the clearance back it will come though with walk-up, it's Lewis and Cantwell both get there and then Godfrey goes back to goalkeeper Crawl who launches the ball upfield, no chances taken there Yeah they're growing in confidence in the Norwich side even Crawl's getting involved in it the crowd are loving it at the moment, Man City so no problems to us, everything is going wide we seem capable of defending their best attacks Comes to the right wing here and Bernardo Silva on it goes to Gundogan, Gundogan's able to hold off Kenny McLean, back it comes to Kyle Walker, Walker will give the ball to Otamendi who scored against Norwich City in their last Premier League incarnation and here's Zinchenko on the left-hand side, on it goes to Stirling, level with the Norwich penalty, cutting in from that left-hand side dangerously, they're living across towards Aguero who's headed it over the bar, Manchester City bursting to life there, brilliant from Stirling whipping that ball in onto the forehead of Aguero and I think it almost happened in slow motion if you're a Norwich fan and you see Aguero arriving in the six-yard box and the ball destined for his forehead and it disappeared over the bar terrific ball in the box, not a lot Norwich could have done about that, Aguero made a brilliant run far post, if he was a couple of inches bigger he may have got ahead on it and made it goalbound but it didn't, it went over the bar and Norwich survived, he's scored 30 or more goals in four of the last five seasons as Aguero so Norwich won't want to give him too many more sights like that one but that's brilliant from Buenvilla to Stieperman and now Stieperman has released Pukki here Norwich have got two against one, Pukki into the penalty area, it's going in for Cavlough! It's 2-0! Norwich City have had two chances in the opening 28 minutes of this game and they've taken them both incredible scenes here now as Cavlough punches the corner flag in celebration, what a Premier League baptism he's having, he's scored against Chelsea, I know he's tapped in against Manchester City after unselfish play from Timo Pukki and nobody saw this coming, Norwich City 2, Manchester City 0 that's brilliant from Norwich City, what a great counter attack and play, got a few plays involved in it but when it did come away to Pukki I thought he was going to take it into the box and shoot which what he would normally have done however he saw Catfell on the left hand side of it but the simplest of tasks to pass the ball in the back of the net, this is unbelievable stuff from Norwich, unbelievable Well they always say when you're playing against big teams when you're the underdogs you have to take your chances and Norwich have done just that and that really opened up nicely some good midfield play from Buenvilla and Stieperman involved and when Pukki was sent away it was two against one, he had Catwell outside him and you were just wondering would Pukki go for goal himself or would he square it, he made the right decision and Catwell got there and couldn't miss really but what a couple of minutes we've had there, Aguero heading over the bar from close range and now Todd Catwell tapping in and Norwich City lead Manchester City by two goals to nil on BBC Radio Norfolk, we're inside the first half an hour still. Look on that attack Chris Carwalk, Otamendi, Jones were all sucked into the centre of the goal giving Todd Catwell so much space on the left-hand side and Pukki easy pass, I mean this is incredible from Norwich but only deserved because Manchester City look like they're still on the team coach to be honest but that's you know that's doing them a big group big favour at the moment the way they are playing, the pace is so slow, it's so easy for Norwich to defend, they're pushing everything wide and when it goes wide the defenders and full backs are stopping crosses coming in. Here's David Silva puts the ball into the Norwich penalty area via a deflection, Amadou gets a foot on it, Byron clears the ball away there, half an hour gone, Norwich 2 Manchester City nil at Carrow Road, here comes Bernardo Silva though looking for something about that, McLean made a block and was taken out by his own teammate and the ball has now fallen for Rodri 25 yards out, onto David Silva, here's Sterling from the left edge of the box, back it goes to David Silva, high ball into the penalty area looking for Bernardo Silva, it's headed across goal, Sterling's head is going to post! That was an incredible bit of football there, Manchester City never really looked fully in control of that but the ball came across, Sterling got his head to it, Krull didn't even dive, he was beaten and the ball stumped the upright. The very first time that Byron's been caught, ball watching, Sterling got behind him, had a free header, should have scored, hit the post. This is some game, here's Bernardo Silva into the penalty area, he goes, gets it across, comes off the Norwich head post but David Silva on the volley and he's scuffed it wide! Dare I say he's no Jeremy Goss too easy with you next to me Gossie, sorry! When it comes to volleying, Prukey's the man! It was exactly that sort of position Gossie. That shape reminded me of Robert Rosario so many years ago, a dip in volley on the edge of the box. Well this is, people talk about fine margins don't they and I'm not going to say luck but you look at the last five minutes Manchester City have gone close through Aguero, then Norwich have scored and Sterling's hit the post but this game could quite easily be 2-1 to Man City or 2-2 couldn't it but Norwich have got the 2-0 lead. And I honestly think they deserve the lead because they've been really really patient and the tactics so far have worked so very very well. Byron playing the ball forward, it's got a deflection, he's gone out of play. Pep's on the sidelines going a bit crazy now, Gina's team up but I can't see where they're going to get involved or where they're going to get back, Norwich are so secure. Is there a long way left in this game? Well yeah, no one's getting carried away but this is quite some position, we've got to enjoy moments like this as McLean is fouled and it's a free kick to Norwich on that right-hand side. That's the one thing, you know that Norwich have got to keep this up for a long time because the goals that Man City get, they've scored five or more in a game 11 times in the last year so they are going to be a threat all afternoon but the fact that Norwich have got this two-goal buffer, I don't imagine anybody would dare to have predicted this at this point. No one predicted it on the on the riverside with me before the game, that's for sure they didn't. But you've got to have faith in your team and they've done incredibly well, yes they have got a hold out for 90 minutes but what I'm trying to say is that Man City look luck-lasting, they don't look as though they're at it. Free kick, Blundee swings it into the penalty area headed away by Zinchenko, Byron's nodded it forward into space on the right wing, Puky catches up with it, tries to step over, gets past Zinchenko and wins a corner and Norwich will fancy this, they've already scored one goal from a corner, this is their second corner of the game. Kenny McLean's already dumped header into the net, it's interesting to see that Amadou despite being one of the tallest men in the Norwich team is not going forward for this. And also interesting to see the 11 Man City players defending. Corner from Blundee played in and Byron was nearly there, it might fall for Tetti, appeals for handball in the penalty area as Man City scrambled it away. Tetti appeals for handball in the penalty area as Man City scrambled it away, Puky's shot blocked by Ultimendi and behind it goes for another corner. Now there were real appeals from certainly the crowd and from some of the players as well that that ball might have hit a hand and certainly I think it's Rottery as he jumps, the ball hits him almost on the crook of the arm as he bends his arm. I think VAR may have a look at this, it's Stones actually, it's Stones, John Stones. It just literally rolled down his arm and that was clear and that was obvious. Now I think we might be getting a VAR check on this, John Stones, the ball certainly made contact with his arm, we haven't been given any messages, it looks like it's play on. Corner, Blundee swings it into the penalty area, headed away by Manchester City, talking point there, Amadou lifts the ball high, too high I think, no, Blundee has kept it in on the left-hand side but was offside and the flag goes up. Well it was Stones who jumped and the ball seemed to roll down his shoulder and the bit where you bend your arm, the inside, whatever that bit of your arm is called, that bit of your arm that doesn't really have a name, that's where the ball seemed to land. For me on the replay that did roll down his arm and if there was someone sat 200 miles away watching this game operating VAR then that little indication to the referee should have been made to say have a look at this incident. Anthony Taylor is the VAR referee, Kevin Friend is the man on the field and was clearly told that they were happy with it, big call, great tackle from Byron on Raheem Sterling, really good opening to this game is Sam Byron and now McLean goes forward, gets tackled, no foul given as he goes down, Orta gets the ball back to Ederson, have Norwich been denied a penalty, Pukki was putting the penalties away in the international break but doesn't get a chance to take one today as Aguero links up well with David Silva, the balls on the left-hand side for Manchester City, hits Sterling in the penalty area, hits cross, cut out by Tim Krall, 2-0 to Norwich City, 10 minutes to get a half time and with that penalty had been given and then Pukki had scored it imagine 3-0 to Norwich. Well I'm imagining 2-0 I'm quite happy with that one I'm not not too surprised that we're doing so well but I am surprised that Manchester City have conceded on a set piece like they did and conceded on a counter attack and play like they did. Well certainly in some of the tournaments in which we've seen VAR and thinking about the World Cup last year that would have been a penalty but the Premier League have come up with this policy that it really has to be a high bar it has to be very very obvious before they they will change something by VAR and Norwich got away with that in the last game when Tom Tribal and it's been admitted this week by Mike Riley the referee's chief but actually West Ham should have had a penalty against Norwich and VAR didn't give it I wonder what he'll think about that one anyway we can talk about that later because here come Manchester City with Roderick in the midfield, striding forward in the carrow road sunshine shadows lengthening here's Bernardo Silver on the right hand side Walker outside him Kyle Walker will deliver into the penalty area beyond the penalty area oh Buendia doesn't really know what to do with it here eventually I think he tried to head the ball out for a corner it hit him on the top of the head bounced up and Tim Crook caught my goodness I'm gonna have to take control of this and came running out and caught the ball. Well done again Buendia he's covering his full back really well he's not used to doing this all this game in terms of defending defending all the time he wants to get forward he wants to drive he wants to be an attacking player but today he's doing defensive duties very well. Stones finds Bernardo Silver on the right hand side Bernardo Silver will skip into the triangle of pips that is still in sunshine towards that right hand corner flag as Man City attack and here is Gundogan once more back to John Stones and now Zinchenko the away mid to Sterling along the ground on the left hand side Sterling accelerates Byron does well to stay with him and eventually plays the ball off Sterling and behind for a goal kick I've got to say Sam Byron who's had to bide his time here to make a Premier League start for Norwich City got his chance because of the Max Ahrens injury in his first 37 minutes against Raheem Sterling he's done so well. He's having an outstanding game and I think he's had enough of Byron because Sterling's come over to the right hand side Chris and they're swapping flanks I thought they'd have done it a little bit earlier but he's getting no change off of Byron he's having an excellent game he's put Sterling over to the right now. Shajamal Lewis is delighted about that Raheem Sterling remember hit the post today eight goals in his last seven matches for club and country but he hasn't scored this evening nobody has for Manchester City Norwich lead this game 2-0 Kenny McLean and Todd Campwell the goal scoring heroes for Norwich City so far still such a long way to go in the game but just to be in this position you can only admire Norwich City and he preys on them for what they've done to get themselves to this point here's Sinchenko on the left hand side plays the ball towards the halfway line and Stones, Stones return to the Man City defence not going to plan at the moment but that's a good ball for him towards Sterling who is now on the right hand side and will try across that's hit Shajamal Lewis and gone behind and it will be a Manchester City corner and again it's all about concentration in the words of Teddy and Krul and players like that at times like this the leaders out there absolutely vital. Krul's got to take control again corner against Gundogan to take they've got De Bruyne on the bench if they need it. Gundogan with the corner from the right for Manchester City heading towards the near post David Silva got there and the ball's gone behind for a goal kick it's quite often when you see a ball go on the ground sort of shin high towards the near post you think well that's a poor corner but the way David Silva got there for Manchester City I wonder whether that was planned Pep Guardiola strokes his chin. No we drilled it in near post quite unfortunate for the Man City player they take a ricochet and go out for a goal kick Norwich have got the confidence to take that goal kick short and Ben Godfrey will fire it up towards the halfway line but Man City steal it and here's Kyle Walker shaving headed these days from Spurs right back finds Ottomendi in the centre circle on again to Kyle Walker Sterling shielding his eyes from the sun on this right hand side so Walker opts not to give him the ball and finds Rodri in that midfield instead Rodri out to the left wing gathered now by Bernardo Silva who's swapped sides of the pitch with Sterling his first chance to have a go here at Buendia the back heel there allows Zinchenko to take over and made off to Bernardo Silva and now it comes to David Silva on the corner of the Norwich penalty area Norwich lead 2-0 under a bit of pressure here Manchester City one in black today coming forward Buendia's working hard today and he's cut that ball out and now Tetti with some good skill on the edge of his own box to find Steferman on the right wing Steferman tries to get a throw in there off Zinchenko the linesman though has given that Manchester City's way and then there's a bit of nonsense there off the ball as Zinchenko goes to pick the ball up he's gone down as if he's been absolutely polaxed by Marco Steferman there didn't look to be a lot in that at first glance I'm sure the VAR officials will have another look at it and decide whether Steferman did anything naughty there but it just looked like it was a player putting his body in the way to prevent Zinchenko from getting the ball in Zinchenko at first glance Zinchenko made a real meal of that he did yeah he did and the embarrassing thing for him it was right in front of his manager and Pep Guardiola he didn't even do it didn't do nothing he didn't even look at him he just walked up and down pensively like he's doing now with his hands in his pockets so we're seeing it again here certainly I can see why the throw in went Manchester City's way because it hit Steferman and then oh Steferman does nothing there does he and I'll be honest for me that type of incident is a yellow card because oh look at this Zinchenko's rattled he nearly gave the ball away to Steferman there but Steferman with his studs couldn't quite control go on it's the most frustrating thing in the game isn't it when a player rolls over like he's been shot he did exactly that when there was no contact whatsoever trying to get the opposition booked it's a disgrace and the thing is we've got VAR now so players that how they think they're going to get away with it anyway before it goes locked from Man City Lewis cuts it out and it's gone behind oh sorry not behind it's going to have to throw it to Man City level with the Norwich penalty four minutes to go to half time can the Canaries hold out until half time if they can go in 2-0 up well you really well hear the applause all around Norfolk I think from this ground at Cairo Road in Norwich Zinchenko getting it for being booed now by the Norwich fans who know exactly what went on there here's John Stones 25 yards out from Manchester City just shifts it to the right and sterling important touch from Campwell the ball that has run into the Norwich penalty area Lewis retrieves it and finds Todd Campwell who will well I said clear what he's done is he's just shacked it into the stands but actually that'll do at this point for Norwich City who are 2-0 up against these champions Lewis did really well there because a lot of players with a ball watched and let sterling run behind him he didn't he didn't even look at the ball he ran with with sterling got his body in won the ball and came out Zinchenko's got the ball you'll know that from the reaction of the Norwich crowd after he was desperate play acting there when Steven didn't really go anywhere near him and he threw himself to the ground what he thought he was doing I don't know he's very fortunate not to have been booked here's Walker on the right hand side forward from Manchester City they go back to the halfway line and stones stones will feed Ottomendi in the centre circle Ottomendi will aim the ball out to the left and Bernardo Silva Gundogan now has it going to want to Roderick Norwich dropping off once again as it happened since it was nil nil but they've never had a two-goal lead to protect his John Stones long long way out here the England defender lays the ball off here to Roderick who will play the ball out towards the left hand side crossing opportunity for Bernardo Silva headed away by Sam Byron drops on the edge of the penalty area though finally for Roderick perhaps the left it will go and Bernardo Silva here is Zinchenko you'll know that for the booze and uh Steven's got the better of him again flicking the ball up and clearing it away two minutes to halftime they're getting no change no change at all from the Norwich back four or back seven everything is going wide he's being stopped Byron's having an outstanding game he's already got rid of um Sterling and sent him across the other side of the wing and it looks like he's going to be doing the same with Silver at the moment he's having a really really good game Man City are so well drilled though some teams at two nil down they panic don't they and the game changes but they're so well drilled they know what they're doing it's so successful yes they've swapped the two wingers around the style hasn't changed has it and Zinchenko's seeing plenty of the ball at the moment as I'm sure you can tell 90 seconds to go to halftime Norwich City two nil off against Manchester City it's extraordinary here comes Raheem Sterling on the right wing crossing low into the penalty area McClain gets a foot to it Janal Lewis prevents the corner and puts it out of play for throwing instead just a moment of hesitation inside the Norwich penalty area there but they weren't made to pay Walker with the throw in from Man City would love to get one back here before halftime here's John Stokes looking for Gundogan now Roderick in the midfield but Aguero who's Aguero's touched the ball and Madhu for company yeah he's had one good chance he hasn't touched the ball or game he may have had one good chance but he's dropping off 30 yards to try and pick it up and doing something with it such as his frustration. Kyle Walker gets the ball back to John Stokes on half way. Yellows yellows the Norwich crowd but realise I think how important it is that they get in at halftime with that clean sheet intact Roderick turns the ball has fallen now for Gundogan in a central position he goes past Tetti gives it to David Silva 25 yards out Zinchenko is arriving on the corner of the area he has Bernardo Silva to take over curling across Aguero's header and they have got one back Manchester City 30 seconds to go before halftime Aguero's had a really really quiet game but he came to life there into the six yard box and not about falling to the net Man City are back in it and Norwich City still have the lead Norwich 2 Manchester City 1 and he was the one for me who's got his team going again he had to drop 30 yards to get a touch and he's shouting at his teammates and banging his hips terrific ball in got between all defenders Norwich City is the smallest man on the pitch Aguero on the six yard line nodded in past Krull it's a shame because Norwich really deserved to go in at 2-0 but they've snaked one back unless hope they can just learn their lesson from that particular one it's the first time Chris on the left hand side they've allowed across the coming of that quality goal number 238 for Sergio Aguero in a Manchester City shirt and he took it really well just to nod the ball beyond Tim Krull and into the net and that will be frustrating for Daniel Farker and for Norwich City but it will concentrate the minds heading up towards halftime I know what I say about 2-0 being a dangerous lead but you know 2-0 at any time against Manchester City is a fantastic position to be in it's now 2-1 and the game's back in the balance but it just goes to show doesn't it yeah it's opposition of this quality you can play really really well for 45 minutes and now Byron making the challenge and dragging down that Manchester City player Bernardo Silva who's beginning to race away from in there and we could get the game's first yellow card here and Byron who we've been praising who's played so well is showing a yellow card there for dragging back Bernardo Silva and Norwich have just now got to keep their heads 2-1 they lead there's not many people that got away from Byron this half but that time he did and he kind of made that little professional tackle knowing that he was going to make a foul Bernardo Silva going over to the left it's worked isn't it his cross I think it was wasn't it with Aguero headed in so 2-1 Norwich lead one minute of first half stoppage time was signalled and we must have just about had that already as we get ready to watch Gundogan swing a free kick towards that Norwich penalty area with the right foot from wide left it's high in the penalty area it's headed down should be away by Pukki and that will bring to an end quite a first half at Carrow Road the champions of the championship are leading the champions of the Premier League by two goals to one yellows yellows Chantler-Moray City crowd have enjoyed themselves in that first half so so much the Canaries defending stoutly defending resolutely not taking any chances really playing smartly in the first 20 minutes or so and then taking the lead incredibly corner from Buendia Norwich's first of the game headed in by Kenny McLean one nil and then Dreamland 11 minutes later a Norwich break two against one Timo Pukki rolling the ball across and Todd Hanwell taps it two nil Norwich City were unexpectedly in control of the game Manchester City had gone close a couple of times Sterling hit opposed Aguero headed one over the bar but just at the end of that first half Aguero coming to life heading in from close range 2-1 the half-time score well the Norwich players are about to come back out onto the pitch and this could be a very very big 45 minutes for City they are beating the champions by two goals to one let's hand back now to our commentary team Norwich City legend Jeremy Goss and of course Chris Gorham. Norwich City have won the first half we'll say that with tongue in cheek because a lot of people were joking when we said they won the second half against Liverpool well they've taken the first half against Manchester City and there is something in that Gossy because whatever happens from here a lot of fans before the game were saying look I just don't want Norwich to be absolutely battered today I just want to even if they lose I want them to have something to take from the game well they've already got that haven't they I mean they're in a winning position they could go on and win this game but whatever happens from here they've given the fans they've given themselves something to get the team into haven't they? Exactly right and just like the Liverpool picture everyone thought that it was going to be a walk over for Liverpool but it wasn't we came away from Anfield our heads held high it was a respectable performance we competed incredibly well we won the second half and that boosted the confidence going into the Newcastle fixture this likewise I think the team have done incredibly well on their defensive duties and they've done incredibly well going forward to score two goals the trick is and the question is can they maintain that for the next 45 minutes? Second half has started Manchester City chasing an equalizer get us underway in their all-black strip no changes made by either head coach or the coach of the team head coach at half time and Norwich straight away winner a throw in their left back position as Jamal Lewis plays the ball off Raheem Sterling Kenny McLean launches the ball away for Norwich it bounces towards the halfway line and David Silva heads the ball back into his own half well reminds you of the team lineups in a moment for those just switching on if you are just switching on you might not believe this it's Norwich City 2 Manchester City 1 goals from McLean and Campwell had Norwich 2-0 up Aguero hitting back right on the stroke of half time that will have given Manchester City something to get their teeth into and here's Bernardo Silva on the left-hand side looking for the edge of the box cut out by Amadou on his Cairo debut but it's come back for Bernardo Silva on the left he's gone past Buendia he's got a crossing opportunity and it comes headed away by Godfrey Kyle Walker with a little header though back to John Stones the man said he looked for some joy on the right hand side with Sterling who hit the post in the first half here's Raheem Sterling again on the right wing swap wings with Bernardo Silva late in the first half and it's good effect because it was Bernardo Silva's cross that Aguero headed in here's Ottomendi coming forward from Man City driven out to the left and Bernardo Silva Bernardo Silva bearing down on the edge of the Norwich penalty area crossing from that left-hand side Amadou's looping header away Rodri puts it back into the penalty area Amadou there again Steeperman there to hook the ball away from Norwich City Kyle Walker gathers plays it to Ottomendi on halfway everyone back behind the ball to Norwich already and we've only played 90 seconds of the second half here's Bernardo Silva playing the ball on here for Aguero to run onto in the penalty area a sliding Amadou clearing the ball away and it's gone out of play from Manchester City throw-in just down below us on their left Boos for Zinchenko who wasn't booked in the first half despite some very obvious play acting after well I'm not going to say a clash with Steeperman because it wasn't a clash here comes Stones rolling the ball to the right wing gathered now by Sterling Kyle Walker joins the attack Walker plays it to Rodri here onto Zinchenko 35 yards or so out to Bernardo Silva on the left-hand side here's Aguero on the edge of the box Buendia comes to life in the Norwich right back position here he's got through so much hard work in this game already and tries to win a throw in there for his team but the ball just won't go out of play Sam Byron then hacks it away headed inside by Zinchenko Norwich are capped on the edge of their own penalty area here McLean does really well to get them out of trouble finding Jamal Lewis on the left-hand side Lewis holds on to the ball then tries to squeeze it forward to Campwell but it's going to take it and Rikishan falls kindly for Rodri Manchester City as you would expect 2-1 down dominating the possession Zinchenko looking again for Bernardo Silva on this left-hand side Bernardo Silva towards the corner of the penalty area everyone's still back for Norwich here's Zinchenko again to Bernardo Silva back it comes to David Silva now and David Silva played that one almost behind Zinchenko but the Ukrainian catches up with the ball he'll be booed every time he touches it for the foreseeable future by the Norwich fans who weren't impressed with his antics in the first half now John Stones comes forward with the ball his feet for Manchester City feeds Sterling on the right-hand side plenty of yellow shirts back looking to keep their discipline Raheem Sterling can't find a way through gives it to Kyle Walker back now to Rodri onto David Silva 20 yards out David Silva finds Bernardo Silva his first time cross is cut out by the impressive Sam Byron Byron takes his time but eventually clears the ball away Norwich have crawling goal Byron Godfrey Amadou and Lewis at the back Tetic McLean and Steeperman in midfield Rondier and Campwell playing either side of Pukian attack and a poor pass there from Manchester City but Norwich have stolen it and Pukian and Steeperman exchange passes and Pukian sent running away into the penalty area in front of the Barclay and he's put the ball just wide that was just like the second goal that Norwich got where they pounced on it a mistake in the midfield set Pukian away that time he was able to square to Campwell this time he was just a little wide tried to roll the ball into the corner of the net but didn't strike it with enough conviction and let off the Manchester City. Otamendi and Jones having a bit of a nightmare there Steeperman picked it up really really quickly first time Rondier has stolen the ball from Otamendi in the penalty area plays it to Pukian this is a great chance this three-one a defensive blunder at the back from Manchester City Otamendi was robbed by his fellow Argentinian Rondier and Rondier put that one on a play for Timo Pukian and the Premier League's player of the month gobbled it up in front of the Barclay and Norwich City well this is getting better and better five minutes into the second half it's Norwich City three Manchester City one. Otamendi must be in shock there often have you seen already the season before being played from the goalkeeper and a key four session inside the area and it's been given away quite simple ball comes across to Pukian missed the first opportunity but didn't miss the second. Well there were there was talk before this game about that Amric Laporte missing from Manchester City and how their defence might miss him and my goodness that was terrible from Manchester City awful Otamendi dallyed on the ball Rondier stole it from him squared it to Pukian Pukian had the composer to actually take a touch six yards out and then gleefully rifled it into an empty Barclay and net and Norwich City are three one up against Manchester City absolutely extraordinary it is it is extraordinary because Manchester City started the game very very well especially down this left hand side with Bernardo Silva however Norwich have just stolen stolen a goal a gift given to them by Man City corner given to Man City at the other end as Aguero is tackled by McClain Norwich were protesting they thought it should have been a goal kick corner it is what a 40 minutes we've got here now on BBC Radio Norwich League 3-1 against Manchester City and they've got a corner to defend here which will be taken by Gundogan on the right hand side played into the penalty area now Otamendi's got a looping header to that one and it's going to drop wide Otamendi has got some amends to make here because well Rondier burgled him in the penalty area and you cannot believe a team that's been champions for the last two years is making mistakes like that I was just going to say how much does this team cost to assemble how good are these set-up backs keep raving about how great they are that was a gift and it was a schoolboy error and Pep Guardiola looked shocked on the bench just sat down looking at his own shaft thinking what do I do next well De Bruyne, Jesus and Mahrez are there they might have an idea for it 3-1 Norwich City lead and Carrow Road we've just had a rendition of On The Ball City that I'm sure you heard by and Jerry Grosta which was as loud as any I've heard at Carrow Road for some time and we've had some wonderful atmospheres here over the last 12 months or so but Norwich fans they know that what they're seeing here is completely unexpected and it's a joy to behold they are beating Manchester City 3-1 in a Premier League game and the thing is as good as Manchester City are going forward the way they've defended today Norwich have scored three goals from four chances really Amadou really giving the ball away to Bernardo Silva Aguero heads it into the box blocked by Godfrey comes back to Aguero who tries an ambitious volley and it took an affliction goes over the bar and a corner it is but a rare mistake at the back there from Ibrahim Amadou who as a midfielder playing as standing centre-back seems like when you go three one up like that it seems to put pressure on you as the team winning we've just got to remain calm in these situations make the right decision at the right time corner played short to Bernardo Silva back now to Zinchenko 25 yards out Zinchenko gets the earliest feet and onto Kyle Walker Walker Pobel that's going to go behind for a goal here and Carrow Road cheers that almost like a goal because they know that this is a some position Norwich have got themselves in I wonder what Daniel Farker is thinking as he strokes his chin over on that far side of the pitch the Norwich City head coach with that black coat on then it would give me the Man City line-up so much has happened since half-time Edison in goal Walker-Stones, Ottomendis, Zinchenko the defenders, Wadrick Gundeman and David Silva in midfield Bernardo Silva now playing on the left Sterling on the right Aguero has scored he's up front for them 3-1 to Norwich City against Manchester City on the right side of the pitch Jamal Lewis plays the ball forward takes a deflection that goes out of play and well in fact it hasn't taken a deflection it's gone Manchester City's way here's John Stones for City who actually could easily have been penalised for a ham ball in the penalty area in the first half let's not forget that Zinchenko for Man City onto David Silva in his last season with Man City forward he comes Bernardo Silva on the left cuts it back now to Aguero has come out to the left wing to get involved onto Zinchenko could be staring in his first ever Premier League defeat today here's Aguero on the edge of the box oh Buendia makes a great challenge there and Cantwell can't quite clear the ball away Steeperman can he puts it up towards the halfway line and Puky's up again here Puky battles with Zinchenko holds him off nicely there does Timur Puky and then back it goes to Byron who plays it in field to Tetti and Tetti sort of hips the ball through towards Steeperman who can't get there gathered by John Stones Norwich City 3 Manchester City 1 I'm almost giving out the score a bit more often this evening just to convince myself that this is really happening here's Walker on the right hand side Sterling in front of him now Sterling sets off cutting in dangerously gives the ball to Gundogan Gundogan's got it to David Silva onto Aguero who goes into the penalty area and gets tackled by a sliding and a committed Ben Godfrey and it's hacked away by Cantwell and Norwich City have still got a full 35 minutes of this game to get through but they lead 3-1 and they are going to give this everything Zinchenko on halfway Byron this time the challenge there he's got to be careful Bernardo Silva's crossed from the left it's hit Amadou it might fall in the penalty area for Sterling with the header it's gathered by Tim Krall and there was a foul there by Byron in that move there's the referee played advantage Byron is on a yellow card and he's going to come under fierce pressure for the rest of this game you know that yeah as all the players are but now Man City have stepped the game up Chris you can see that they're going faster with the ball they're moving it quicker they're driving down this left hand side in particular that's a danger but Norwich have got to stay calm and stay composed and do what they'd normally do when they defend the ball Cantwell now plays the ball forward Cookie setting off again here it doesn't go up and the ball has gone through to the penalty area for Edison anyway I mean this is the thing Man City are going to pile the pressure on but the way this game has gone Norwich have pinched three goals on the break really haven't they they haven't had many chances and you feel that they may get more here's Zinchenko on the left to Bernardo Silva oh lovely takes the ball away from Buendía who's had a really good game today Buendía already onto Zinchenko now on the left hand side David Silva gathers plays it back to Zinchenko into the area helped on then to David Silva who will cross fiercely from the left hand side good header from Byron Cantwell just about gets enough on the ball to smuggle it away from the penalty area De Bruyne I think is about to come on yeah we expect these subs to come on now Pep Guardiola is not going to be happy with this the way the performance is going at the moment for Man City the game continues those Zinchenko 30 yards out gets the ball back from Gundogan and now it goes towards John Stones forward will come Stones looking for Sterling on the right away from Sterling and can't control and he's gone out for a throw in Man City have got a game at Shakhtar Deneck in the Champions League on Wednesday they probably would have preferred to have given players like De Bruyne a little bit more time off tonight but they're going to have to bring him on because Gundogan is being replaced here by Kevin De Bruyne who is quite a player to be able to bring on in any circumstances just changes things for Norwich again and they're also taking off David Silva to bring on Gabriel Jesus so Gundogan going off, David Silva going off and on will come De Bruyne and Jesus that's quite a combination coming onto the pitch now yeah and let's see if it does make a difference but at the moment these really expensive Man City players have no effect on the Norwich side who are compact they stay close together they're working as a team they're not panicking at the moment and they really really deserve to be this 3-1-0 De Bruyne is on, a forward teammate of Tim Closer back in his Wolfsburg days I'm sure Closer will be really disappointed he hasn't got the chance to go toe to toe with him on the pitch today but he'll be so proud watching on as his teammates have taken a 3-1 lead against Manchester City but here's Sinchenko straight away looking for Rodri away from Teti Rodri up to the edge of the penalty area here plays it there to Aguero who gets the ball out of his feet and will get the shot in eventually and it's charged out by Buendia and behind for a Manchester City corner it was charged down by three or four yellow shirts then no opportunity to get a shot on target well done Norwich again and this is what I'm saying stay compact bring your teammate close to you don't let any gaps appear between you and the strikers and they've now got De Bruyne on the set pieces which is a different threat altogether the Belgian gets ready with this corner from the left hand side for Manchester City plays it into the Norwich area now good delivery and oh my goodness Otamendi was a whisker away from getting on the end of it but Stieperman did enough he got his head to it and has guided that one out of play and Stieperman is the first to be clapping and G and his teammates up to stay strong and stay composed it was a terrific delivery it was only a corner but you can see the class in De Bruyne and the way he's set pieces on Manchester City have won all of their last nine away games in the Premier League and here they are 3-1 down to Norwich with almost an hour played De Bruyne has gone the width of the pitch and will take this corner from the right this time whipped in dangerously headed away by McClay Pukic can't complete the clearance though and Bernardo's silver shot is then blocked and Norwich get it a little bit further away from goal this time and McClay had a dress rehearsal on Monday night he was in the Scotland team beating 4-0 by Belgium I think De Bruyne was involved in all four goals that Belgium scored Sterling breaks into the penalty area here gets beyond Krul but can't quite work it goalwards I think Krul might have just got a touch on that and behind it goes for a corner Norwich you can just sense Norwich are just trying to get a handle on what Manchester City have done with their system here they're just reorganising a little bit aren't they It's the brilliance of De Bruyne he's put a 30-yard diagonal ball into the box past Norwich there another corner Norwich lead 3-1 but they're defending a corner De Bruyne delivers curling towards the end of the 6-yard box Steekman heads it away again Pulsar Zinchenko on now for Bernardo's silver who worked it to the right-hand side De Bruyne has driven cross comes off a Norwich player and then Ben Godfrey has worked that one away so firmly It's actually struck the roof of the River End stand on its way behind for a corner They are defending manfully here in Norwich City but they've got plenty more of it to get through Corner De Bruyne again from the right-hand side Kehl towards the edge of the penalty area this time it's a poor one and Amadou has run outside the penalty area to head it away and then Kyle Walker gives Ederson a difficult back pass but Ederson the goalkeeper is standing 40 yards from goal and is able to bring it under control and release Bernardo's silver Bernardo's silver now to that right-hand side and it is De Bruyne De Bruyne already putting a ball into the penalty area Godfrey cuts it out Bernardo's silver gets the shot in it's blocked It's headed back towards the penalty area Byron emerges to head the ball away Here's Rodri from Manchester City wide to the right and De Bruyne De Bruyne calls in another ball that Godfrey belly flops and throws himself to hit the ball away once more Jamal Lewis battling with De Bruyne it's out of play throw in Man City get on with it they're chasing the game they're 3-1 down at Carrow Road Here's Zinchenko 35 yards plus out back to Ottomendi and now John Stones Stones will play the ball on to Kyle Walker Walker hits it an ambitious diagonal here over the head of Bernardo's silver Another play for a throw in and Norwich City withstand the spell of Manchester City pressure and there'll be plenty more of those but how hard have Norwich worked? They're putting everything on the line here They're working so hard now's the time to kill the game off kill the pace of the game off Slow the tempo down take your time on throw ins Set pieces, goal kicks, take your time Ottomendi launching one forward for Manchester City, Norwich lead 3-1 Steakman gets the better of Rodri seems to get a foot on the ball but the referee says free kick they've taken it quickly they've taken it quickly Manchester City and the referee was still has a couple of Norwich players in his face so tells him to go back and take it again Norwich City 3, Manchester City 1 at Carrow Road, McLean, Kempwell and Pukki on what could be a famous night for Norwich City supporters still half an hour to play De Bruyne stands now with his hands on his hips, number 17 on his back Wonderful player had such an injury hit season last year has come back this season and has been like a new signing for Manchester City He's had a really good start to the season Guardiola has had to put him on to try and get his team back into the game De Bruyne's free kick, decent delivery and it nearly bounced all the way through Krul saw it late but catches it and Tim Krul rolls to the floor there Delightful really with the ball in his hands Talk about quality already that's five really effective balls that De Bruyne has whipped into the penalty box including the corners, including that free kick Well done Krul, he kept his eye on that anticipating a little touch off one of the strikers, never came followed the ball down, gathered it in his arms and we can take our time again and try and kill the game off again It's gone back to Godfrey in the Norwich left back position Talk about a dilemma that Daniel Falker might have in a moment as Manchester City launch a high ball forward from Stones there Godfrey slightly misjudging the bounce against Aguero but recovers and heads it back to Tim Krul Now Daniel Falker has got Grant Hanley on the bench today He's a recognised defender, who he said he thought he could get 20 minutes half an hour out of if he needed him But if you bring him on, and try and shore it up a little bit you almost disrupt what's gone so well don't you up to now No I agree, I agree I think we should just take it as it is at the moment Norwich though I'm sure the legs will get tired, they've done so much running It's a foul by McLean on Roderick but the referee will allow play to continue because Manchester City have good possession with Raheem Sterling on the right wing Raheem Sterling now takes on Jamal Lewis who makes a good challenge Great well-timed challenge from the Norwich left back and it's a corner We're seeing a real series of these corners now and Kenny McLean has got a yellow card to go with the goal but he got it in the first half and I don't think he can have too many complaints about that How long Roderick is the sort of challenge that you normally see yellow cards given for Another corner There's a willingness there isn't there These midfield players and Norwich today have been brilliant the way they've closed and chased and shielded the ball Corner number 10 for Manchester City De Bruyne to take on the right hand side delivered towards the penalty spot Godfrey powers the header away 3-1 Norwich lead They're under pressure here, serious pressure Zinchenko plays the ball to Bernardo Silva Bernardo Silva the Portuguese player rolls it to the right hand side and De Bruyne who delivers Gabriel Jesus jumps, Byron gets the better of him headed away by Canva Back it comes to Zinchenko on the left hand side And it's Sterling tied to the touchline on the left wing It's a Zinchenko who lifts the ball into the area and Byron just stands Firm footed and heads the ball away And now Steakman with a chance to just bring the ball forward for the first time in a while And they're going to throw it to Norwich City They're going to make a change, Manchester City, I think Zinchenko's got to come off He's had a real shocker today Including the elaborate dive profile that never really was in the first half Crowd are always having a go at him Rodney has just been dispossessed on halfway by Bernardo Silva who comes sprinting forward Amadou with a good touch to get the ball away from Aguero and it's a throw in He's got to Joe Cancello on the bench The Portuguese left back if he wants to take Zinchenko off But he can only make one more change, Pep Guardiola This team are 3-1 down at Carreirova, still 25 minutes to go Ottomendi finds stones, played again to Ottomendi who was badly at fault for Norwich's third goal Tackled by Buendia and he put it on the plate for Pukki And that's why Norwich lead 3-1 Here's Kyle Walker, gives the ball to Ottomendi Ottomendi drives a firm pass along the ground to Bernardo Silva on the left-hand side As Manchester City attack the river end, going right to left The sun just dropping down behind that river end stand now Walker puts the ball towards the edge of the penalty area The Norwich fans are going through every kick with their team here Here's Kyle Walker, onto Roderick, Man City come again De Bruyne on the right wing, whips another dangerous ball in and there's Amadou All action, heading the ball away They're ending up on the floor having done so But they just made sure Aguero couldn't get on the end of it Now Kyle Walker looks again for the run over De Bruyne who's got space and brings it into the Norwich penalty area from the right-hand side Just got it stuck under his feet there for a moment now And the ball's run behind for a goal kick A rare mistake from Kevin De Bruyne Well that was, appeared the worst there but Lewis stood his ground De Bruyne actually fell over on the ball in the end but he's shown his class But we're capable and we're coping with this pressure very well Chris Everybody is doing their job incredibly well And now's the time again once again just to keep it and kill the pace of the game Man City are high pressing, you never know, we could even get another chance to score Teddy plays the ball into the left back position where Kenny McLean is waiting for it Back to Godfrey in his own area Godfrey passing the ball to Buendia, one touch back to Teddy Norwich perhaps over-complicating things deep inside their own half And they've given the ball away And here's Gabriel Jesus, he'll be desperate to get involved here But Buendia's tattered him really well And now Pukki chest it down to Campwell And here comes a Norwich counter-attack First time they've gone forward since the third goal Here's Buendia, halfway inside the Manchester City half Stiepman in acres of space and arriving And with the ball at his feet now, edge of the penalty And Marco Stiepman gets it through to Pukki And it might run for Stiepman, no, an important touch at the back there And Manchester City clear Norwich when they do go forward though, they've got Man City worried 3-1 Norwich lead, Gabriel Jesus hits the ball out towards the right-hand side It will stay in play, Kyle Walker sent very wide in order to keep it in He's given the ball to Kevin De Bruyne Now it's Sterling on the right wing Walker's made the run forward and he cuts it back And Ben Godfrey blocks and it's behind for another Manchester City corner More applause at Carrow Road Almost halfway through the second half Norwich City 3, Manchester City 1 is the extraordinary scoreline That we're bringing you on BBC Radio Norfolk this evening I mentioned the high press game, Man City are playing now Because they have to, it did open up another chance for Norwich City It's a counter-attack which they did However, it's swinging the other way now, a corner De Bruyne from the right-hand side delivers Ottomendi's header, oh, and Krul got his body in the way and did enough There was almost a touch in front of him, Aguero was in there, Sterling was in there But Tim Krul gathers Well done Tim Krul, well done defensively It was a clear-cut header He got the ball on target But it didn't really trouble Tim because it came straight at him Ottomendi's first Manchester City goal back in 2015 was against Norwich Alex Nialira went, Norwich were beaten 2-1 at the Atihad Now for Steeperman, a Norwich attack Steeperman works it to the left-hand side, knowing instinctively where Todd Cantwell would be Lewis behind him, back again to Cantwell Lewis again Now McLean and the ball is passed all the way back to Ben Godfrey On halfway, Godfrey though, driving the ball forward, it's cut out The ball is missed the challenge, and Norwich have continued possession too easily And here comes Raheem Sterling, running at Norwich City Amadou with an important tackle, but it's not away yet Here's Bernardo Silva, no, he's off balance And Guendia has possession, and then backheels the ball into his own area Allowing Amadou to clear Hearts in mouths, 10 stuff at Carrow Road, magnificent stuff at Carrow Road What a match this is, what a night this is Guendia turns away from trouble, and has his heels clipped by Bernardo Silva And the yellow card is going to come out for the Portugues player here For some say could take over from Cristiano Ronaldo, the most important player in the Portugal team in years to come Well, in his younger days, Ronaldo was beaten here at Carrow Road as a Manchester United player Godfrey just sprinted 10 yards to grab hold of Amadou and hug him and high-five him for that brilliant interception It was a crucial interception as well, Man City odds on to get a shot on target The two centre-halves are strong-strong The noise at Carrow Road is spine-tingling The Orange fans know that they're witnessing something potentially very, very special here Amadou might have undercut to back pass Cruel Alert gets there before Gabriel Jesus Here's Cantwell, goes down, no foul Manchester City in search of a way back into this game Raheem Sterling to De Bruyne De Bruyne on the edge of the penalty area, what a block from Kenny McLean And the ball rolls for Cantwell And Cantwell with his hair tied back, brings the ball forward, on to Jamal Lewis Lewis tackled by Walker, and now it goes for Maurice Dryad And they've got a chance here to wind the clock down I think we might hear back some Riyad Mahrez coming on Yes, another Manchester City sub, a two-time Premier League champion With Leicester, of course, and with Manchester City He's going to have 20 minutes if he comes on now, which he's not going to To try and help them back into the game McLean picks the ball towards Byron, who takes that almost in his stripe But Zinchenko is there to take it away from his toes It's 3-1 to Norwich City Here comes Manchester City goal, Bernardo Silva Brandeis dropped into that right back position, filling in for Byron Bernardo Silva gets the better of him The ball comes to Rodri and then Zinchenko who plays it in field to Aguero Poor touch from him, Byron's found Puky And Zinchenko has been leaded to the floor by Rodri And that will be a Norwich free kick and another chance just to relieve the pressure 20 minutes to play, Canary Call coming up at full time Bernardo Silva has worked his socks off all game and especially there He's such an important player down this right-hand side Covering Sam Byron, following runners, tracking back, tackling I'm sure the flamboyancy on the ball when he can go, when he's in space And he has done today, he's looked an excellent player as always But defensively I think he's been brilliant today Norwich City 3, Manchester City 1 Listen to the crowd, they know what they're seeing here They know how special this is for the Canaries Free kick, Tim Kroll spots the run of Puky He's gone out towards the left-hand side And will go shoulder to shoulder with Kyle Walken Either of them get the ball originally And then Walken's able to chop it away towards the halfway line It bounces awkwardly for Lewis who's under pressure from Gabriel Jesus But he's got it back to Ben Godfrey And now here's Abraham Amadou who could well be having a Carreiro debut to remember It's an emergency centre-back, Byron onto Marko Stieperman Stieperman turns, gets the ball to Gwendija here 25 yards out, Norwich on the attack here Gwendija scoops it to Puky, Puky's in the area to the left of goal Can he cut the ball back? He can Gwendija just couldn't quite get the ball out of his feet to begin with And then he's tackled by De Bruyne But Norwich has got a chance to keep the pressure on here With a brilliant Byron who's been sent to the floor And it's a free kick Foul on Sam Byron What a debut in terms of a first start for him as well He came on briefly as a sub against Newcastle in the Premier League In the previous game that Norwich won And now Stieperman is roaring at the bar He's urging them to keep the noise levels up 18 minutes to go, Norwich City 3, Manchester City 1 Outstanding, Byron and Amadou, outstanding Normally defensive duties I keep talking about But then the attack in third They were closing and pressing and running and chasing and squeezing And they're doing incredibly well for Norwich And now we've won this free kick Too far out for a shot, I would have thought What is it, 30, 35 yards? Dead centre? I'd say that's all of that, but why not? Let's test the keeper, let's see what happens It's our day, isn't it? If this goes in, it is McLean and Gwendija standing over the wall Ederson standing slightly to the right of his centre of his goal And Mbembe might fancy this He takes the shot on and it skims along the ground and wide Told you it was too far out, Gossie No, I think it was definitely a shooting opportunity I think he could have just hit the target That's all, I made the keeper make a save He's pulling his shorts up in anger and frustration That he didn't hit it cleaner Bernardo Silva has gone off And Mares has come on And they're making use of that new law here Where the players have to go off on the nearest side of the pitch So he's gone off by the Man City fans And on will come Riyad Mares The Algerian With his team Trailing at Carrow Road by 3 goals to 1 And 17 minutes left Inchenko hits the ball out towards the right hand side Tackle comes in from Janal Lewis on Mares, and it's gone out of play for a throw into Norwich City And that's it, his form has been so good 4 league titles since 2012 They've won the last 2 They've won the last 9 away games They've scored 5 or more 11 times in the last year And yet they find themselves 3-1 down at Carrow Road With 16 minutes or so to go Lewis gets the ball back to Godfrey He clears his lines Stones returns it McClean controls Gives it to Jamal Lewis Lewis works the ball away Pukki sends the opportunity for a moment Ottomendi has come at the head of straight out of play for a Norwich throw in This goes to prove you could never underestimate Norwich City here at Carrow Road With the atmosphere the fans are creating The skill of the players The heart and design The passion of the players that are on show Here's Gwendolyn away from two challenges And coming forward here And he's got the ball towards Cantwell on the left Cantwell has managed to turn it onto Gwendolyn On the left wing they're linking up brilliantly Gwendolyn back to Cantwell who almost gets himself into the penalty area But John Stones is only just too strong But Gwendolyn's blocked tackle, nearly falls for Pukki And Ottomendi has to... Another panicky flash and put the ball out into the stands for a throw in It's getting noisier and noisier here I've just seen one of the Norwich coaches Or medical staff or somebody Go out and tell one of the substitutes perhaps to get ready Let's see There's Stieperman Turns the ball onto Cantwell Back towards Stieperman Kyle Walker's got the better of it The ball comes to Sterling on halfway He hits it forward early, De Bruyne has made the run De Bruyne beats him to it, Teti collects the ball after a nice header from Sam Byron And then gives it back to the Norwich right back On the right wing Up to Pukki He's got it back to Byron Byron was second favourite for that ball against Sterling you know And it's passing over 15 to go Norwich 3, Manchester City 1 And if you're a Norwich fan you will live every one of these 15 minutes You really, really will Amadou plays it forward The ball bounces down for Alexander Teti Harrow Road crowd again playing their part Amadou, infield to Teti Teti back to McLean And McLean calmly And confidently plays the ball To Lewis on the left hand side And they've got it back to Jamal Lewis, good play from Buendia Lewis scampers forward Goes down on the challenge of Walker And referee, Kevin Friend rewards Norwich City A free kick, Pep Guardiola Animated that beige jumper again Going in all directions on the side of the pitch As he waves his arms about To get messages across to his team You just feel the belief In the players now can't you I've mentioned many of the Norwich City team and players today And their great performance But Teti then has had a really, really good spell Of just keeping the ball and passing it To a yellow shirt And they're actually, dare I say, making Man City Chase the ball Here's Steeperman for Norwich City Cutting into the penalty area from the left hand side And he's gone a long way with it here, Marco Steeperman In the end he's shut down by Stones, but he's still got the ball Now they've managed to just get it away from him Somehow in Manchester City, cleared But a deflection has made it pull kindly for McLean Tapuki in the penalty area just couldn't quite Turn the ball past Ottomendi And Man City bring it away It's a belief on the pitch There's still a sense of disbelief off the pitch in the stands From the Norwich City fans As Ben Goldberg gets the better of Gabriel Jesus And then goes back to goalkeeper Krul Who clears that ball away Zinchenko still being booed We know he's going to play the full 90 minutes now Unless he gets sent off because They've made the three subs John Stones now coming forward Ball at his feet from Manchester City And within 25 yards of the Norwich goal And he's fed Sterling, left corner of the penalty area Raheem Sterling's cross and Guero's header over the bar That's twice he's done that in this game He has scored a goal, but he's also headed Two chances over the bar And we've got 13 minutes to go And Norwich City could be on their way To what would be one of the most famous Premier League victories, not just here But given the circumstances, I think anywhere In the Premier League history, and that is not Overstating it No it's not, no absolutely agree with everything you say Incredible result as we look at it today We've just got another injury here Gossie which should just break off, it's Gwendia down in the end of his own box This will give people time to recover Give players time to get some drink inside them Causing the game with an injury But wow how this Norwich back four Performed, stopping crosses coming into the box Forcing everything wide And when it does come centrally Ben Godfrey, Amadou outstanding Jamal Lewis closing brilliantly Sam Myron Fantastic in his opportunity that's been given to him today Teddy McLean You can name all of them They've collectively worked their socks off And they've literally stopped this Man City team playing Playing around them or playing through them They've gone ahead and scored their goals In Norwich City, they've stolen a couple They've gifted one It doesn't matter, they're up And we'll take that gift They've just got to hold on Chris And it will be a great game And we'll see what happens They've just got to hold on Chris And it will be one famous victory here at Carroll Road They're taking Wendier off It's been a great game today He's had a brilliant game And I would have thought that's only through exhaustion And it'll have to do I should have learnt by now with Daniel Falk I was saying earlier on Maybe they should bring on Well actually they want to come back on Wendier But they've got Josip Dermic ready to come on The striker And Wendier wants to rejoin proceedings They've got two players waiting to come on Here's Jamal Lewis on the left hand side Lewis sending it forward to Stieperman There's a break on for Norwich, even with a man short And it's set Stieperman onto Pukki Oh, Pukki caught by Kyle Walker there Right on the edge of the box, corner of the area really And Pukki's down And Kyle Walker will be penalised It's a free kick, so what are Norwich going to do here? I was sure Wendier was going to come off Because he's been led away by the physio And Dermic is going to come on As we see A replay, that's a clear foul by Kyle Walker What an opportunity Norwich have got here A free kick, corner of the penalty area Pukki and Stieperman are getting between the lines now The space is opening up between the midfield Man City, midfield and the back four Both of them finding themselves in space Pukki on that particular occasion Received it, turned, run up Walker And Walker's had a pretty poor game for me today Could only just foul Pukki To stop him in his tracks Another good play by Stieperman Another good position for Norwich by the way Free kick Norwich, corner of the penalty area Played into the Man City box Too close to the keeper, Ederson who gets that Already scored from one set piece today Norwich the opener from Kenny McLean If he'd gone for one up there in front of the Barclay Well you would have heard Noises that would have threatened the rick to scale I think Still Dermich hasn't come on And Wendier's not moving particularly well But he's stayed out there for now What have we got? 10 minutes to go Norwich City 3, Manchester City 1 At Carrow Road Here's Zinchenko, onto Aguero Back to Zinchenko who burst into the penalty area And Byrom's managed to somehow play the ball Between Sterling's legs and away Campwell's clear and so it's hit Team Pukki, they've gone out of play for a throw-out 10 minutes to play Norwich City 3, Manchester City 1 And the ball is in the net Manchester City 1 Here's Ottomendi now Plays the ball inside to John Stones Kyle Walken Aims it towards the right wing An opportunity here for Mares to make something happen Plays it in field to Stones Now they try the luck on the left wing with Zinchenko Sterling Left edge of the penalty area for Manchester City Still no great panic about the way Manchester City are playing They're working the ball forward carefully On to Mares who now does deliver And the header from Jesus Deflected over the bar, corner They're getting there successfully These set pieces and these crosses Chris Instead of Mares going down the right hand side Crossing an out swinging ball with his right foot He checks in and delivers an in Swinger with his left Same thing happened here With Silva down the left hand flank just a moment ago We had Mares with a corner on the right hand side With the left foot, swings it into the Norwich penalty area Now dangerously, Stiefenman I think Just did enough, oh I'm sure Stiefenman touched that one for a corner But a goal kick's been given It looked it didn't it but it will take it as a goal kick And I think maybe a sub coming on now Dermot can now come on for Buendia And there was me earlier on talking about the possibility Of bringing Grant Hanley on to shore it up Not Daniel Tharko Let's stick another striker Rob Buendia has set up two of the goals today His best performance in the Premier League so far And he's applauded off And no wonder by Cara Road, he's played his part Not just the assists but that work rope from Buendia tonight Absolutely, he showed the other side of his game today He's been a team player defensively Helping out Running with runners Tracking back defensively Getting blocks in, closing down, pressing And then when the opportunity comes He can deliver and make assists He's played really really well, deserved that applause And there's Daniel Tharko He doesn't change his methodology, it's just well We've taken an attacking player off so we'll stick another one on And Dermot's the Swiss striker, he's had his own injury problems this season Limited to two brief substitute appearances so far On he comes But he'll have to work just as hard as Buendia was And I'm sure that's what Daniel Tharko will have been telling him Here's Walker, racing over the halfway line With the ball from Manchester City To the feet of Gabriel Jesus, back to goal Finds Sterling on the left corner of the penalty area He's skipped away from Dermich there Sterling, Norwich have plenty back Sterling's found a way into the penalty area To Jesus, onto Aguero It might fall here for Jesus, great tackle from Byron Jesus has picked it up again on the edge of the sixth yard It's so busy in there he can't get the shot away And Norwich by sheer weight of numbers Have smuggled that ball out of play for a throw in Waiting for the shot to come in He's trying to dribble that in the back of the net Well done Norwich, come on, keep this defence going Proper backs of the wall stuff as Man City come again Mares moves inside Great block from McClain And Cantwell launches it away And Edison, the Manchester City goalkeeper Has just gathered possession on the right wing Almost on the halfway line And he's got the ball from the right side Right wing, almost on the halfway line Everyone back for Norwich City and you can understand it Daniel Fokker doesn't like parking the bus But if there ever was a time to do it Six and a half minutes to go And they're 3-1 up against Manchester City at home Here's De Bruyne, to Zinchenko on the left hand side Zinchenko again Gives the ball to Stones Forward comes John Stones 25 yards out Plays the ball right hand side Now Kyle Walker to De Bruyne Who's 30 yards out Pulling the strings, finding Sterling on the left hand side Curling from Sterling And beyond everybody, from behind for a goal kick And Steedman collapses to the floor Saying that he needs a bit of help with Cramp And he's getting help on one leg from Teti And on the other leg from Roderick The Manchester City player This is something isn't it Gossie Let's just take a moment to appreciate this Absolutely, and we've got around about 10 minutes more of sheer effort And determination and will and desire Left in this particular game Left for every single player And for a player to go down of his stature With Cramp goes to show you just how much work he's putting into it But that's going for every single player But they're still solid They're still focused, they're still concentrating They've got such little time to hold out now They really must hang on Dennis Shrubbini is going to come on in a moment That must be a reaction to I think Steedman perhaps running out of energy Or Pukki maybe Let's see Pukki's got his goal today 3-1 Norwich lead 5 minutes to go Here's Stones 5 minutes past stoppage time I should add Stones, Pukki has given up the chase for once And has allowed Stones to hit the ball towards Sterling Left edge of the penalty area Raheem Sterling Teasing Byram, getting into a central position Raheem Sterling shot, big deflection And the header taken comfortably by Tim Krul Still 3-1 Well done, showed Sterling inside Go down on the outside because he's dangerous You show him inside where the yellow shirts are Where your numbers are, that's exactly what he did there Got the shot away Ricocheted, ends up in Krul's hand All is safe Big boot from Tim Krul and it's going to go straight through to Edison Well it would have done, but Ottomendi has thought No we can't even afford that extra 10 seconds We need to get the ball going again And here they come The pacey Kyle Walker still full of running All-Campwell makes a challenge And maybe Missed on that and the free kick Has been given and the yellow card is coming out for Todd Campwell who just thought he could get something on that As Walker broke away He's been shown the yellow card, third Norwich players go in the book Yeah it was a foul Yeah, he Desperation to contribute and get that Tackling, stop him driving forward He's lunged in with his right foot Walk around the ankles, it was a definite foul And that's the right word for it, it was a lunge And now a free kick and then city Right wing It's played in by De Bruyne Punched by Krul, he's done enough He's done enough for now Norwich need to reset because Sterling has gathered The ball on the left hand side Raheem Sterling on his right foot Gets the cross in dangerously Towards the far post and back across goal from Aguero And turned over brilliantly by Tim Krul That's a great save because I think most people thought that ball was going to curl behind for a goal kick But Aguero made something of it And Krul has saved it very well Terrific, terrific, everyone's playing their part And Tim Krul's coming to his best now Switch on, switch on, I thought he'd get a short corner there Tenth time, three minutes to go Plus stoppages, 3-1 to Norwich City Against Manchester City Mahrez corner, played in from the right Headed on by Rodjery, scrambled away by Norwich City But Zinchenko's going to hit one from distance And it's blocked by Teti The ball falls to Jesus on the edge of the penalty area And the ball is going to bounce now for Sterling Well forward on the left hand side Everybody back for Norwich City Jesus has got away from Dermich on the edge of the penalty area Sets up Rodjery who will let fly into the net Krul got a hand to it, couldn't keep it out We've got some finish ahead of us now Two and a half minutes to go plus stoppage time It's Norwich City 3, Manchester City 2 Rodjery has his first goal for the champions But all that's done is brought another roar out of the Cairo crowd 3-2 to the Canaries Just worked it well around the area Manchester City got it to the edge of the box He was 25 yards out with a load of yellow shirts in front of him But he struck it well Bottom of Tim Krul, white hand pose Just sneaked in And I suppose in the end it was the only way they were going to score Because they're trying to warp the ball in every time Manchester City Or deliver from the red It was a decent strike Largely disappointed to concede Can we hang on? There must be about four minutes left surely But it's a good start There must be about four minutes left surely We've got to hang on to this now Because we fully deserve this victory It's the substitution we were all anticipating Steakman goes off as Trevenny comes on Just to get someone with a little bit more energy And a little bit of freshness out there But this is the problem isn't it As well as Norwich have done The more that a team like Manchester City attack They eventually find a way don't they And that's without Norwich really doing much wrong 3-2 Tense, tense stuff at Cairo Road Pukki is penalised for grappling with Rodri Who takes the free kick quickly And Manchester City know They've got an opportunity now in this game Here's Aguero, aims the ball out towards the right hand side Mares gathers Mares on the front foot against Jamal Lewis Gets the cross in, Lewis makes the block It's a Manchester City corner Mares is a sharp, quick, very skillful player He's stuck with him Stopped the cross coming in, did exactly what his job should be He did really, really well there Corner To Manchester, who've just got back into this game 3-2, we're in the 90th minute Dobroina's corner Should be headed away by Godfrey and here's Pukki Whacks the ball further upfield Edison, the goalkeeper Is on the halfway line for Manchester City He's good with his feet, but he plays this one short To Zinchenko Ukrainian international Plays it inside to Kyle Walker Even Pukki looks too tired to give chase there Here comes Dobroina In the Norwich penalty area for Dobroina to try and hit He's headed down There for Sterling in the box Won't quite run for Jesus, it's gone behind It came off a Norwich player last It will be Manchester City's 15th corner of the evening Norwich with more defending to do We've got 10 seconds plus stoppage time He dealt with a lot of these corners really well Got to do it again now Short corner Dobroina finding Jesus Back to Dobroina on the left hand side It's played to Zinchenko on the edge of the box Norwich has got it And it's headed behind by Byron Corner number 16 on the way 4 minutes of stoppage time Norwich are 4 minutes away For a famous victory, but they've got a lot of work to do still They know it Corner's been taken to Walker here Walker bursts into the penalty area Crosses, blocked by Kenny McLean And launched Into the Norfolk sky by Kenny McLean Back they come Norwich lead And the ball out of play The ball out of play for a throw in It's a Manchester City throw It's been taken by Zinchenko Comes to Dobroina Pep Guardiola pointing, urging his team forward here In search of an equaliser Here's Rodrik, who scored a moment ago Canwell cuts that one out though And again launches it And Ederson the goalkeeper is almost up on the halfway line But Norwich are too tight to chase it down He's on the line, he's on the line He's on the line, he's on the line He's on the line, he's on the line He's on the line, he's on the line Four minutes of stoppage time was signalled We've had a minute of the stoppages Here comes Dobroina again It's a tackling defence at the moment Aguero's got past Dermitch Aguero's shot, Tim Croce Your heart's in your mouth there Aguero famous for some last minute heroics in the Premier League A typical turn, a twist A dribble in the box And a great opportunity to score and shoot He did all of them well He did all of them well but he didn't expect him to make that save Now Tim's just got to hold on to this for a while And he will do And with the left foot he'll launch the ball upfield Oh, big kick Stones, gets his head to it for Manchester City Ottomendi, oh, heads it back to the goalkeeper With Pukic sniffing But he's got enough on it So we've got Two minutes and fifteen seconds Of the stoppage time to go The Carrow Road crowd that are whistling That's too optimistic, there's plenty of football left in this year 3-2 to Norwich City Here comes Manchester City Here comes Zinchenko Finds Sterling on this left hand side, the near side Pushes it to the edge of the penalty area Cross comes in, headed away by Norwich City But it's come out to De Bruyne on this left hand side Now Zinchenko Now De Bruyne once more Sterling in front of him, on the left Brings it into the penalty area for Manchester City Tees up Gabriel Jesus who's going to get the shot in No good free blocks, shot comes in eventually And Krul saves again And Norwich have got 90 seconds to see this game out And there are yellow shirts on the floor They're dead on the feet Because of the work they put into this game Why is football sometimes worse When your team is winning in stoppage time That feeling, there's nothing quite like it There really isn't The tension Grant Hanley may be about to come on Norwich launch it long through Tim Krul It's fallen for Rodri in the centre circle Pukic! Won't give him a moments piece but Rodri's too strong He holds him off, he finds Aguero 30 yards from goal Jamal Lewis with a heroic challenge there To take it off Aguero But Aguero recovers Now Kompel goes looking for the ball And the free kick has been taken quickly And Norwich are under big pressure It's played into the penalty area here And it's Raheem Sterling for Manchester City Gets the shot in, oh Krul saves it again We're in the final minute of stoppage time Norwich are 3-2 up Daniel Barker is going crazy on the side of the pitch He'd like to be out there the way he's whirling around The stadium's going to erupt in a few minutes time It's erupted already I know Long kick from Tim Krul Misjudged by Zinchenko Trebene bearing down on the Man City penalty area But he doesn't get the better of Ottomendi Maybe Man City will have another chance No! Norwich has nicked it 25 yards from goal Onto Todd Kompel now in the penalty area But Kompel's only interested in that corner flag in front of the snake pit Showing maturity and experience beyond his years here Todd Kompel holding the ball in the corner flag Eventually conceding to throw it 9 seconds of the stoppage time to go Man City have it They play it short to Jon Stone Norwich putting him under pressure Norwich have done it! That is a wonderful Carrow Road night A night to remember It is one of the best results in Norwich City's history It's probably one of the biggest surprises In Premier League history And that is not overstating it Norwich City with an injury list as long as you're on
