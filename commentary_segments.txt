[0.00s -> 6.28s]  How do the Norwich players feel at this point, Jerry? Excited, nervous?
[6.28s -> 10.72s]  Absolutely loving it because the fans will be right behind them, that'll settle their nerves down.
[10.72s -> 15.08s]  They all want first touches, give it to a yellow shirt and get in the game early on.
[15.08s -> 18.16s]  Jamal Lewis up against Bernardo Silva looks...
[18.16s -> 19.88s]  Wow, that looks a problem, that one does.
[19.88s -> 22.48s]  Wicall Walker backing him up, that right-hand side.
[22.48s -> 26.80s]  The game's started and Norwich City are playing the ball confidently away from the edge of their own penalty area.
[26.84s -> 30.16s]  At the Barkley end, eventually Jamal Lewis's clearance is charged out,
[30.16s -> 32.32s]  and Ben Godfrey does clear it towards the halfway line.
[32.32s -> 38.24s]  Norwich in yellow and green, Manchester City all in black here, not in their usual sky blue coloured kit.
[38.24s -> 42.44s]  But Norwich City enjoy plenty of the ball early on, albeit deep inside their own half,
[42.44s -> 46.24s]  as they defend the Barkley end going from right to left as we look at it.
[46.24s -> 48.24s]  And the ball goes back to Tim Crewe.
[48.24s -> 52.76s]  And I'm sure Daniel Falk will be relieved, his experience absolutely vital today.
[52.84s -> 55.32s]  He's played it long, it's a Campwell who can't quite control,
[55.32s -> 60.36s]  and Manchester City can get a foot on the ball for the first time with their defender Nicholas Ottomendi.
[60.36s -> 62.36s]  And back it goes to Ederson, the goalkeeper.
[62.36s -> 65.40s]  A few questions about the Manchester City defence at the moment with La Porte,
[65.40s -> 69.08s]  their best defender being ruled out, almost in a Norwich City style really.
[69.08s -> 73.24s]  He's going to be missing for quite a few months, so the opportunity knocks for John Stones,
[73.24s -> 76.60s]  the England defender who's been out of favour under Pep Guardiola recently,
[76.60s -> 77.80s]  and he gets his chance today.
[77.80s -> 81.92s]  The ball is sprayed to the right wing and Kyle Walker, we see him setting off for the first time.
[81.96s -> 84.60s]  Campwell's got back and got the foot in, and that was important,
[84.60s -> 87.40s]  but then Jamal Lewis fails to give the ball back to Campwell,
[87.40s -> 90.68s]  and Manchester City have possession inside Norwich territory.
[91.28s -> 95.96s]  Teddy, already you can see him waving, shouting, trying to organise that team in the midfield.
[95.96s -> 97.20s]  He's the captain today.
[97.84s -> 103.72s]  Stones for Manchester City on halfway, looking for Aguero who gets involved in the game for the first time,
[103.72s -> 106.40s]  back on the halfway line, he's dropped deep to get involved.
[106.40s -> 111.28s]  Norwich giving everybody back behind the ball in these early stages as you might expect.
[111.36s -> 116.64s]  It's back on halfway with Ottomendi and now Stones, who enters the Norwich City half.
[116.64s -> 118.32s]  Pukki goes to close him down.
[118.32s -> 121.68s]  Aguero works the ball around the corner, Manchester City building a threatening attack here.
[121.68s -> 125.00s]  They've got Raheem Sterling involved on the left-hand side in the penalty area.
[125.00s -> 128.64s]  Comes back out to David Silva, who weaves his way past Teddy, tries across,
[128.64s -> 131.80s]  Buendia gets the foot in, that's important, it's gone for a corner.
[131.80s -> 135.52s]  Byram tried to keep the ball in play, actually that might not have been a very good idea
[135.52s -> 138.84s]  because it was going to fall for Manchester City in an attacking area,
[138.88s -> 141.56s]  but Byram hadn't managed to keep it in play.
[141.56s -> 145.76s]  It will be a Man City corner and a test of concentration here, first set piece of the game.
[145.76s -> 148.48s]  Definitely set of concentration, focus.
[148.48s -> 152.24s]  Send Byram on Raheem Sterling, he's got to get very, very close to that player,
[152.24s -> 155.08s]  we know what he can do, how dangerous he can be.
[155.08s -> 158.60s]  So a corner, looks like Gundogan is going to go across the tape.
[158.60s -> 162.24s]  The German international from the left-hand side, in front of the Barclay end for Manchester City,
[162.24s -> 165.92s]  who imagine their first serious attack of the game, it's driven in towards the near post point,
[165.96s -> 170.16s]  Buendia got a foot on it, headed down, and Krul is able to catch it gratefully.
[170.16s -> 175.00s]  Buendia actually got there at the near post, but all he could do was help the ball on its way into the middle,
[175.00s -> 178.24s]  and it was slightly awkward there, with a scrum of players in front of Krul,
[178.24s -> 180.12s]  but nobody got a decent contact on it.
[180.12s -> 182.56s]  It's going to be hard for Man City to get his head on the ball there,
[182.56s -> 188.56s]  we had 11 players inside the 18-yard box, very determined Norwich now to keep compact.
[188.56s -> 191.40s]  When they play, they look like they're getting wide, they're getting width,
[191.40s -> 195.56s]  the playing were confident so far, so they've eased into this game nicely.
[195.64s -> 198.04s]  The ball's gone back to Tim Krul, the Norwich goalkeeper,
[198.04s -> 200.04s]  who clears his lines comfortably there.
[200.04s -> 203.96s]  Bounces into the midfield now, and Steeperman collects for Norwich City.
[203.96s -> 208.28s]  They use the ball well, Norwich City, when they have it, and they don't use the ball well there.
[208.28s -> 211.80s]  Steeperman looking for Jamal Lewis, but it was a yard or two too far in front of him,
[211.80s -> 215.16s]  and it's rolled out for a throw-in, and that's one thing they can't do today, I know it's obvious,
[215.16s -> 221.48s]  but when you've got it, letting Manchester City have it back easily, you cannot do that very often, can you?
[222.20s -> 225.96s]  Interesting to see whether Norwich would adapt a high-press game, they're obviously not doing so,
[225.96s -> 229.56s]  they're getting compact and behind the ball, making Manchester City work,
[229.56s -> 233.32s]  the spaces for them to be showing danger, but no, they cannot give the ball away.
[233.32s -> 237.16s]  When they get it, Norwich have to keep it, and that's where the confidence comes from,
[237.16s -> 241.16s]  maintaining possession, and we know how good they are, Norwich are keeping the ball, they've got to do it today.
[241.16s -> 244.76s]  Almost a mistake by Artemendi at the back there, Steeperman sensed the chance to close him down,
[244.76s -> 248.36s]  but Artemendi just got away from him in time, the ball is now played back to Edison,
[248.44s -> 252.36s]  he's been closed down by Buendia, he's 25 yards from his own goal here, the Manchester City keeper,
[252.36s -> 257.08s]  but he's comfortable in possession, he's given it to Zinchenko, it was just a split second where it
[257.08s -> 261.64s]  looked like Buendia may steal the ball there, but we know how good Edison, the Brazilian goalkeeper,
[261.64s -> 267.64s]  is on the ball, that very vivid neck tattoo that he's got is visible, written from all the way up
[267.64s -> 272.52s]  here on the gantry in the south stand, nil-nil, Manchester City, as you would expect, enjoying the
[272.52s -> 276.76s]  lion's share of the possession at Carra Rhodes, Zinchenko playing the ball out to the left-hand side,
[276.84s -> 280.60s]  there's some space out there for Bernardo Silva, he's tried to work the ball into the penalty area,
[280.60s -> 284.36s]  David Silva I should say, sorry, and it's come off a Norwich player, he's gone out for a throw into
[284.36s -> 290.04s]  Manchester City, level with the Norwich penalty area, nil-nil, you can really sense the nerves
[290.04s -> 293.64s]  around Carra Rhodes ahead of this one, of course there's excitement as well, but
[294.68s -> 298.20s]  Norwich saw against Liverpool in the opening day of the season in that devastating first half,
[298.84s -> 302.36s]  and Norwich actually didn't play that badly, but still found themselves 4-0 down,
[303.24s -> 306.04s]  great noise inside Carra Rhodes, the fans certainly doing their bit,
[306.68s -> 311.80s]  Otamendik coming forward from Manchester City, the ball played out to the left-hand side and
[311.80s -> 316.76s]  Zinchenko, and then lovely bit of skill and a little return pass and Zinchenko's away on the
[316.76s -> 320.44s]  left-hand side, Byron should make the challenge here though, after a heavy touch from Zinchenko,
[320.44s -> 324.76s]  Byron does make the challenge, and wins a free kick as well in the right-back position, and there's
[324.76s -> 329.48s]  applause for the former West Ham player, and that's the thing, it's a shame that Max Arons is missing
[329.48s -> 333.96s]  because of injury, but Norwich knew they lacked cover in that position, they knew that might happen
[333.96s -> 338.52s]  at some point in the season, and they got Byron in in the summer for just this sort of thing,
[338.52s -> 342.36s]  so they are covering that position. I mean he did very very well there as well, he'll be feeling a
[342.36s -> 346.92s]  lot better now, he's got his first tackle in, he's got the crowd cheering him, what's important down
[346.92s -> 352.04s]  that right-hand side is that Bondier and Byron work together so closely and so well, they've got to go
[352.04s -> 356.68s]  with runners, they've got to force the ball wide, then they've got to close to stop crosses coming in.
[357.40s -> 362.52s]  More nil, Norwich want to throw it, halfway inside the Manchester City half, and even that is being
[362.52s -> 367.48s]  applauded by the supporters at the moment. Steeperman gets a touch, Manchester go past one man City
[367.48s -> 371.24s]  player, but then the ball is hit back rather fiercely to goalkeeper Edison, who just nonchalantly
[371.24s -> 375.64s]  sticks a foot out and controls it, and passes it out to Kyle Walker, and here we go with Walker
[375.64s -> 380.44s]  charging forward on this right-hand side, he's so quick, but surprisingly left out of the last
[380.44s -> 384.36s]  England squad, so he's had the international break off, and he will be fresh. Here's Gundogan in the
[384.36s -> 389.80s]  midfield, rolling the ball to Zinchenko now, Sterling out on the left-hand side hugging the
[389.80s -> 393.80s]  touchline, level with the Norwich penalty area, beginning to cut inside, Bondier makes a challenge,
[393.80s -> 397.96s]  a feel for a handball there by Manchester City against Bondier, and that's not been given,
[397.96s -> 401.80s]  but it will be a Man City throw in, and they look to keep the tempo up, six and a half minutes gone,
[401.80s -> 407.08s]  goalless at Carrarote, here's Rodri in the midfield, Spanish signing from the summer,
[408.28s -> 412.12s]  kicking Fernandinho out of the team at the moment, so he can't be bad can he, and the ball goes to
[412.12s -> 416.68s]  Bernardo Silva on the right-hand side, the Portuguese who's tricking Jamal Lewis here,
[416.68s -> 421.40s]  bringing Kyle Walker into play, Gundogan now will work the ball in field to John Sturms,
[422.28s -> 426.52s]  Zinchenko who is the left back, but he's seeing a lot of the ball in a sort of midfield area at
[426.52s -> 432.68s]  the moment, here's Rodrik from Manchester City wide to the right, and Kyle Walker is well forward
[432.68s -> 438.44s]  here, Cantwell goes to close him down, the ball played to Gundogan, and now Zinchenko again who's
[438.44s -> 442.60s]  in a very very central position, and that's a dreadful ball from him out to the left-hand side,
[442.60s -> 447.08s]  which was meant for Raheem Sterling, but he wasn't there, it's a deliberate play isn't it Zinchenko,
[447.08s -> 450.44s]  whenever the ball is on the right-hand side from Manchester City, he's the left back, but he almost
[450.44s -> 454.36s]  sits in the midfield. It's brilliant how they rotate all the persons that are playing today in
[454.36s -> 458.36s]  their normal positions, they'll move inside, they'll move outside, they'll rotate nicely,
[458.36s -> 462.52s]  they're versatile, so even Aguero, Aguero you can see he's frustrated and won't get a touch,
[462.52s -> 466.68s]  so he's come 30 yards off to pick the ball up, anyway here we go. Clever stuff from Norwich City,
[466.68s -> 470.76s]  Godfrey and McLean playing one touch stuff on the edge of their own box, and eventually then releasing
[470.76s -> 475.32s]  Jamal Lewis up the field, who gets to the halfway line and then thinks better of it, the ball
[475.32s -> 479.32s]  ricochets kindly for McLean, back to Jamal Lewis on the left, I mean in most games from there you
[479.32s -> 483.56s]  would see him take the ball further on, but there seems to be a deliberate ploy here, and you can
[483.56s -> 487.96s]  understand it, the Norwich call backs just to sit a little bit tighter than they usually do.
[487.96s -> 491.72s]  Amadou playing the ball across to Godfrey, across the edge of his own area, now Jamal Lewis just
[491.72s -> 496.12s]  helps the ball along the left-hand side, Steeperman makes it here, and he's knocked the ball past Kyle Walker,
[496.20s -> 501.56s]  again played it early towards Puky, but it's beyond the finished striker and off to Mendy sweeps up, and
[501.56s -> 505.00s]  Norwich didn't quite have a chance there, but just getting up towards the edge of the Man City penalty
[505.00s -> 509.56s]  area drew ooze and arse from the supporters, because when you've got Puky in the team, the Premier League
[509.56s -> 514.52s]  can't know that if anything drops to him, Norwich have got a chance for that. Well we had some space
[514.52s -> 520.28s]  down the left-hand side, utilised that well, ball broke, put it to Puky, unfortunately couldn't get on
[520.28s -> 524.20s]  the end of that one, but Norwich I don't think we mentioned Jamal Lewis there, that was another bad
[524.20s -> 530.44s]  tackle. Yeah well Steeperman went in hard on Rodri, and it looked like a free kick, and it was a free
[530.44s -> 534.84s]  kick to Manchester City, but after the decision had been made, Cantwell had committed himself to the
[534.84s -> 537.96s]  challenge, and he was caught by the Man City player, he's going to be all right I think, Cantwell,
[538.52s -> 541.88s]  you worry every time a Norwich player hits the deck that it's going to be another injury, but
[541.88s -> 546.76s]  free kick to Manchester City, it's been taken, nearly nine minutes gone, 0-0 on BBC Radio
[546.76s -> 551.00s]  Norfolk, the champions for the last two years, Manchester City coming forward with John Stones,
[551.08s -> 554.52s]  unchallenged, halfway inside the Norwich half, lazy it out to the left-hand side,
[554.52s -> 559.40s]  Tchenchenko plays it on, there's Sam Byron, first Premier League start for Norwich City to clear the
[559.40s -> 566.04s]  ball away, but Norwich are so deep it's easy for Man City to collect on halfway. Walker in the centre
[566.04s -> 571.64s]  circle, sprints the right, to the right-hand side, he's picked up, one of the Man City fans about three rows back,
[572.36s -> 576.28s]  and relief from the Norwich fans as that pass goes astray, definite change of tactics from
[576.28s -> 581.16s]  Norwich today, and you can understand it, it's partly the results they've had in the first part
[581.16s -> 584.92s]  of the season and how open they've been, it's partly the fact they're playing Manchester City,
[584.92s -> 588.68s]  and partly the personnel they've got, you can see why Norwich are being a little bit more cautious
[588.68s -> 593.40s]  today, can't you? They've been a bit hesitant going forward and I think naturally so, with the team
[593.40s -> 598.44s]  that's out there today, I'm sure Daniel Farker has just given a strong instruction for the first 10-15
[598.44s -> 603.48s]  minutes to whether any storm that's going to come their way firstly before they start getting on the
[603.48s -> 607.88s]  ball and looking forward, and they're showing everybody why, Chris, everyone who's on the ball,
[607.88s -> 612.20s]  they're getting compact in the middle, pushing Man City to use the wide areas where they can.
[613.32s -> 618.36s]  Here's John Stones, Manchester City, an England defender, brings it up towards the halfway line,
[619.56s -> 623.08s]  Norwich are good slow to closing down, he's got time to hang the ball out towards the left wing,
[623.08s -> 627.24s]  and he's picked out the chest of Raheem Sterling, who brings it under control beautifully,
[627.24s -> 631.88s]  exchanges passes with David Silva, comes down to Rodri, and then Tynchenko plays the ball back to
[631.88s -> 637.00s]  the halfway line, and Ottomendi, and the ball is now played to Kyle Walker, his last pass went out
[637.00s -> 641.32s]  for a throw-in, that's a better one from him, to the feet of Bernardo Silva, back to Kyle Walker,
[641.32s -> 645.00s]  he's coming in towards the penalty area here, but the man City move breaks down, a loose pass from
[645.00s -> 649.00s]  David Silva, and Norwich are able to steal possession back, and with Ben Godfrey,
[649.00s -> 655.16s]  they're able to play their way out of trouble. Kamal Lewis, the left back, to McLean, he's further
[655.16s -> 658.60s]  wide still, plays it onto Campwell, lovely football from Norwich here, inside their own half,
[658.68s -> 663.24s]  and now Steeperman releases Campwell, this is great stuff from Norwich, Campwell up towards the halfway line though,
[663.88s -> 669.00s]  and Rodri is there, puts his body in the way, and Campwell will not get past him, but Norwich almost
[669.00s -> 673.24s]  playing Man City at their own game briefly there, we won't get too carried away. Well played everybody, I think
[673.24s -> 677.48s]  you can give the opposition too much respect, especially Manchester City, they come here with
[677.48s -> 682.84s]  such a reputation that you can actually feel the hesitancy from the Norwich City players, but in that
[682.84s -> 687.72s]  smooth group of players there on the right hand side, they were keeping it, playing two touch, passing
[687.72s -> 693.00s]  into a yellow shirt, they'll gain confidence from this Chris. Ottomendi brings the ball into the Norwich
[693.00s -> 700.92s]  half, finds Zinchenko on the left hand side, you can see Pep Guardiola, another grey or beige jumper over on that far side, animated,
[703.40s -> 708.84s]  shouting, there's Stones, playing the ball up to Aguero, Tessy gets the foot in, but the ball's
[708.84s -> 713.16s]  rebounded back for Sergio Aguero, now it's Sterling in the Norwich City penalty area, pulls the trigger,
[713.16s -> 718.44s]  blocked by Byron, and out for a throw into Manchester City, Byron just did enough there, got tight to
[718.44s -> 724.28s]  Sterling in time to block the shot, and it remains goalless on BBC Radio Norfolk. Norwich are going to
[724.28s -> 727.88s]  have to get through an awful lot of hard work today, Tetti gives the ball away, on the edge of his own
[727.88s -> 733.88s]  penalty area, here's David Silva playing the ball back to Rodri, now the ball played towards the right
[733.88s -> 738.28s]  hand side, a little bit of a loose pass, but Norwich were sitting so deep, Kyle Walker is able to catch up
[738.28s -> 742.20s]  with the ball here, and then just angle it back towards the halfway line, and Stones,
[742.84s -> 746.36s]  and Norwich, we don't see this very often from Norwich, every player behind the ball,
[746.36s -> 750.12s]  bottom ending, coming forward, halfway inside the Norwich half,
[750.76s -> 755.80s]  a flight to the left hand side in Zinchenko, on now to Sterling, he's very wide on that left hand side,
[755.80s -> 759.56s]  back again to Zinchenko, and here's Rodri, Steeperman goes to meet him, wins the challenge,
[759.56s -> 764.20s]  but Rodri has made a strong stuff, and even after losing a challenge, he somehow emerges back with
[764.20s -> 767.64s]  the ball at his feet, two or three times, he's done that already in this game, Rodri,
[769.32s -> 774.04s]  red hot air balloon just making its way over the city centre of Norwich at the moment, that we can
[774.04s -> 779.72s]  see, the lengths people will go to to try and get a view of this game, here's Bernardo Silva on the
[779.72s -> 786.12s]  right hand side to Kyle Walker, Bernardo Silva once more, Gundogan outside it, on the right wing,
[786.12s -> 791.96s]  coming in field now, and scooping the ball to Rodri in the centre circle, now it's onto Zinchenko,
[792.04s -> 795.16s]  Sterling's made a run on that left hand side, he looks frustrated, is in Zinchenko, ops,
[795.16s -> 799.00s]  not to find him, instead they've got it forward to Gundogan, edge of the penalty area, lays it off to
[799.00s -> 804.76s]  Aguero, but he's back to goal, back to Kyle Walker now, option outside him, in the shape of Bernardo
[804.76s -> 809.08s]  Silva, he's going to test Jamal Lewis here, Bernardo Silva, curling the ball across, and
[809.96s -> 813.56s]  a cross shot really, it's gone behind for a goal kick, yeah, worth telling you I think that Bernardo
[813.56s -> 818.28s]  Silva, as Manchester City's player of the year last season, and when you're winning that award,
[818.28s -> 822.28s]  in the company that they've got, that's worth remarking on isn't it, that's something to be
[822.28s -> 827.64s]  very proud of. He's a terrific player, but they all are, and when you look around the team they're
[827.64s -> 831.32s]  terrific, but I think Norris can be really pleased with where they started this particular game,
[831.88s -> 836.20s]  they're keeping Manchester City very quiet, the pace of the game is slow, they don't even have to
[836.20s -> 842.12s]  work hard to prevent trouble coming their way, they're just shadow play, they push them wide all
[842.12s -> 847.16s]  the time, when it goes wide it comes back in and goes back to the centre halves, Norris should be
[847.16s -> 851.88s]  pleased so far. They can see the pitch from that hot air balloon, or do you think it's too far away up there?
[852.60s -> 855.96s]  Probably too far away isn't it? I think they've got a view there with binoculars.
[856.84s -> 859.24s]  It's going out sort of over towards the north of the city now.
[861.56s -> 865.48s]  It's going to be Jamal Lewis who will play the ball long, lovely header on from Pukki, gathered by
[865.48s -> 869.56s]  Steeperman in the centre circle, and now played into the path of Buendia, who's up towards the
[869.56s -> 873.80s]  edge of the Manchester City penalty area, challenged by Sterling, Buendia from on the ground plays it to
[873.80s -> 877.88s]  Byron, and the attack keeps going, and here's Steeperman looking for the ball into the area,
[877.88s -> 881.72s]  cut out by Rodri, he is cutting an impressive figure in the early part of this game, Norwich
[881.72s -> 886.28s]  can't find a way past him at the moment, and it's switched to the right hand side of Bernardo Silva.
[887.24s -> 891.00s]  But I think there's opportunities there, we just saw it once again for the second or third time,
[891.64s -> 898.52s]  in that transition between defending, parking a bus at the 18-yard box, as they say, to that
[898.52s -> 902.68s]  counter-attack in play, there are opportunities, and we saw on the right hand side, we've seen it
[902.68s -> 907.00s]  on the left once, I think if Norwich are a little bit more confident, a little bit more assertive
[907.00s -> 911.72s]  and aggressive, they can open up this back four for Manchester City. Quarter an hour gone,
[911.72s -> 915.88s]  0-0, but here come Manchester City, and it's David Silva, edge of the penalty area, lays the ball off
[915.88s -> 920.28s]  under pressure from Amadou, and Norwich get there, and now Cantwell brings the ball up towards the
[920.28s -> 925.00s]  halfway line, Cantwell scrapping and battling, losing possession, and then a rash challenge,
[925.00s -> 929.00s]  he doesn't make any contact with Walker, but the pass has already got away by Manchester City,
[929.08s -> 932.12s]  and it's Gundogan onto Zinchenko, low towards the edge of the penalty area,
[932.12s -> 936.36s]  helped on by Aguero here, David Silva wide to the left of goal, place it back towards Aguero,
[936.36s -> 941.00s]  who tried to chest it into the path of Sterling, but Norwich will get it away through Buendia,
[941.00s -> 944.92s]  who rides a couple of challenges inside his own half, and is allowed to continue, and then
[944.92s -> 949.56s]  play extensively into the path of Jamal Lewis on the left hand side. Norwich growing into this game,
[949.56s -> 956.92s]  0-0, here's Buendia on halfway, Buendia looks for Marco Stieperman, the tall German rolls it to the
[956.92s -> 960.76s]  left hand side, and Jamal Lewis, and the Norwich passes are beginning to find their targets,
[960.76s -> 964.60s]  Lewis coming forward for the first time in the game on the left hand side, then retreating with
[964.60s -> 969.32s]  the ball still at his feet, oh the ball's gone under the foot of Kenny McLean, but he retrieves it
[969.32s -> 974.44s]  and finds Buendia, Cantwell, thumps the challenge back, the pass back, it takes a couple of
[974.44s -> 978.28s]  deflections, and eventually falls kindly for Norwich City, and it's Ben Godfrey who will look to spread
[978.28s -> 983.16s]  the play out towards the right hand side, and Byrom, an ambitious ball, Byrom does really well to keep
[983.16s -> 987.80s]  that ball in play going back towards his own half, and Norwich fans appreciating what their players
[987.80s -> 991.72s]  are giving this at the moment, Amadou, it's been two minds here, as he goes up towards the halfway
[991.72s -> 998.04s]  line and decides safety first, goes all the way back to Tim Craw. We'll know. I don't know how much time
[998.04s -> 1002.20s]  you spend as Daniel Farquhar as any manager before a Manchester City game talking about how you're
[1002.20s -> 1005.88s]  going to attack them, you probably spend a disproportionate amount of time worrying about
[1005.88s -> 1011.16s]  yourself defensively don't you? I think it's overloaded in this this game so far Chris, because
[1011.16s -> 1015.16s]  the defence are doing very well, collectively as a team you're defending well, we're keeping them at
[1015.16s -> 1020.28s]  bay, they haven't really caused us any trouble, Aguero was terrific in that one incident, but
[1020.28s -> 1025.56s]  recovered, we survived that particular attack, and then we counter-attack, but I just think they need
[1025.56s -> 1030.84s]  to get hold of this game a little bit more, be more confident in their own ability to take on Man City
[1030.84s -> 1035.16s]  and drive forward with the ball. Manchester City's last two Premier League visits to Carrow Road have both ended
[1035.16s -> 1039.72s]  0-0, you'd have got very good odds on that being the score today, but it is at the moment, 17 minutes
[1040.04s -> 1044.44s]  here's Buendía for Norwich City, out to the left-hand side, Jamal Lewis has it, and he has space to
[1044.44s -> 1048.52s]  work with here, and he will use that space, and he's up towards the corner of the penalty area, back
[1048.52s -> 1053.88s]  it goes to Kenny McLean, on to Buendía, a long way out here Buendía, pushes it into the path of
[1053.88s -> 1058.60s]  Teddy who's come roaring forward, on the right-hand side drills a low cross in, it's off the shins of
[1058.60s -> 1064.76s]  Zinchenko, and behind for a Norwich City corner, it's that sort of evening where even winning a corner
[1064.76s -> 1069.24s]  gets the crowd going, and Stieperman is now warring his arms around and trying to get the river end
[1069.24s -> 1073.88s]  singing and making some noise, it looks like a cup tie this. This is what we should be having from
[1073.88s -> 1078.04s]  the first whistle, the crowd getting behind the players and not being fearful of the man sitting
[1078.04s -> 1083.00s]  side but driving at them like they just did there, well done Teddy. Corner, Buendía from the right-hand
[1083.00s -> 1091.32s]  side delivers, McLean's head on, and he's in, Ferris getting taken the lead against the champions, Kenny McLean
[1091.32s -> 1097.32s]  rising at the near post to head the corner firmly beyond Ellison, Carrow Road is going crazy here,
[1097.32s -> 1103.00s]  there's a long time left in the match but that is some moment, Norwich City are in front against
[1103.00s -> 1106.92s]  Moch as the City and it's a Kenny McLean header, what an L at Carrow Road.
[1109.88s -> 1116.28s]  What a goal, great delivery from the corner, great run into the box, and a two-ripple finish,
[1117.88s -> 1121.80s]  now that's what you can see, now that's what you can do, you've got to believe in yourself when you go
[1121.80s -> 1125.56s]  out there and play these tough teams and I think they have been holding back and holding back
[1126.12s -> 1131.72s]  defensively and maybe naturally so but when you've got space in front of you and you exploit that
[1131.72s -> 1137.00s]  space and you take the game on, you drive forward against the man sitting side, they become hesitant
[1137.00s -> 1142.84s]  and they get them in that box from that corner, what a great goal, what a great start from Norwich.
[1143.48s -> 1147.88s]  Well he's already the mayor of Norwich, if they see this one out, goodness knows what he'll be up
[1147.88s -> 1151.72s]  tonight but that was a lovely header and go back to what we said a moment ago,
[1151.80s -> 1155.40s]  we've got the cut tie atmosphere, how often in these sort of games, when you're the underdog,
[1155.96s -> 1160.12s]  does a set piece make the difference and that's Norwich's first corner and they've scored from it.
[1165.48s -> 1169.56s]  Listen we're going to dominate this game, just be careful of the set pieces and they weren't,
[1169.56s -> 1173.40s]  they had about 10 players in the box and still we got forward and still we scored.
[1174.36s -> 1180.12s]  And actually, if Norwich had conceded that goal, we'd be furious wouldn't they, a player like Kenny
[1180.12s -> 1184.92s]  McClain getting a header in but anyway here come Manchester City, big few moments ahead for Norwich
[1184.92s -> 1189.40s]  now as they try to hold on to this lead and Buendia have set up the goal, has found Campwell here,
[1189.40s -> 1193.80s]  deep inside his own half, Campwell turns the ball forward, Puky just about holds it in but has given
[1193.80s -> 1199.48s]  it away in doing so to David Silva and now Sterling is halfway inside the Norwich half, back to Rodri,
[1199.48s -> 1204.20s]  out to the left hand side it will go and Zinchenko looking for the run of Sterling, back out to
[1204.20s -> 1208.04s]  Zinchenko on that left wing, there's a crossing opportunity here, Zinchenko takes a touch, now
[1208.04s -> 1213.16s]  delivers and there's Amadou on his Carowroad debut to head the ball away and then Campwell is
[1213.16s -> 1217.64s]  battling here with Rodri, the Spanish player has eventually got the ball forward, it rolls under
[1217.64s -> 1221.80s]  the foot of Kyle Walker but he got enough on it to eventually bring it under control and then curl
[1221.80s -> 1225.40s]  the ball in from the right, Ben Godfrey's there to head it away, it'll drop to Sterling on the edge
[1225.40s -> 1230.20s]  of the penalty area, Sterling getting into a central position, shooting and the ball flies wide
[1230.20s -> 1234.12s]  and there's no deflection but there are oohs and ahs from the Carowroad crowd out of relief.
[1234.20s -> 1239.24s]  Norwich are winning this game, they lead Manchester City 1-0 and it just feels like a really big 5-10
[1239.24s -> 1244.84s]  minutes now doesn't it Gossie, just do not keep this 1-0 for as long as you can. I think it needed,
[1244.84s -> 1249.96s]  I think the crowd have played a big part in us taking the lead, well done Amadou, he really
[1249.96s -> 1253.88s]  attacked that ball that went up in the air in the 18-yard box and that's what it means, it'll need
[1253.88s -> 1258.76s]  a leader at the back there to dictate and clear the ball when needed but also dictate and pull
[1258.76s -> 1263.32s]  people around him to be organised to stop Man City coming through the middle, push the ball wide all
[1263.32s -> 1269.24s]  the time. Norwich City's last two Carrowroad goals against Manchester City both scored by Russell
[1269.24s -> 1275.48s]  Martyr so it's something about Scottish internationals in this fixture, that's a game that finished 4-3
[1275.48s -> 1278.76s]  you might remember a few years ago under Chris Hughton, Boundeer has just been penalised, just a
[1278.76s -> 1282.68s]  bit eager there going in for the challenge on Sterling and it's a free kick to Manchester City
[1282.68s -> 1288.04s]  inside their own half. Norwich lead 1-0 here against Manchester City, if you are just joining us
[1288.28s -> 1295.80s]  that's what's happened, Kenny McLean a header from a corner, I mean you look at Norwich's threats from
[1295.80s -> 1301.56s]  corners and you think about Amadou and Godfrey, Pukki of course as well but McLean arriving there
[1301.56s -> 1308.76s]  and a wonderful header beyond Edison and the Canaries are in front, here's Sterling tickled
[1308.76s -> 1313.48s]  well there by Byron who's managed to see him back towards the halfway line, John Stoves from the
[1313.56s -> 1318.04s]  Everton now rolls it to Kyle Walker, we've got Bernardo Silva out here on the right hand side
[1318.04s -> 1322.28s]  the near side as they attack the Barclay ends, now Gwendoan proving difficult to shake off the ball
[1322.28s -> 1326.28s]  but at least Norwich have forced Manchester City back into their own half with Stoves
[1326.84s -> 1332.92s]  here's Zinchenko the Ukrainian international who's never lost a Premier League game, plays the ball
[1332.92s -> 1337.80s]  out to the left wing, here's Raheem Sterling level with the Norwich penalty area here Sterling goes
[1337.80s -> 1344.12s]  past Buendia, Sterling now looking for the run of David Silva, Byron gets the block in and having
[1344.12s -> 1348.92s]  scored from a corner, a moment to go, Norwich City must now defend the corner, Byron doing a good job
[1348.92s -> 1355.80s]  on Raheem Sterling so far, got to stay compact now, Pruel's got to organise his defence, organise that six yard box
[1358.20s -> 1365.08s]  Gwendoan goes out to take this corner again, former teammate of Moritz Leitner, he's Borussia Dortmund days
[1365.16s -> 1370.84s]  Gwendoan's certainly fit and on the set pieces for Manchester City, about to deliver this corner into the
[1370.84s -> 1376.60s]  penalty area from the left, into the Norwich area it goes, Krul has got a fist on that and it's fallen for
[1376.60s -> 1380.36s]  Buendia who brings it away and then can't quite release Pukin, in fact the ball is ricocheted
[1380.36s -> 1384.76s]  kindly here for David Silva in a good position, McLean worked so hard to get the ball off him though
[1384.76s -> 1389.96s]  and then launch it long, ah Puky can't quite latch onto it on halfway but for a moment there I think
[1389.96s -> 1394.20s]  Buendia's eyes lit up because from the initial clearance there was a chance to get Puky away and
[1394.20s -> 1400.04s]  he didn't quite take it, Manchester City come again, Tchenko on that left hand side,
[1401.00s -> 1407.24s]  infield to Jon Stokes, Stokes just 30 yards from goal, Aguero with an eke touch to David Silva on the edge of the penalty area
[1407.24s -> 1413.24s]  into the path of Raheem Sterling from the left, the block gets in and McLean has cleared it away with a little bit of help from Amadou
[1413.24s -> 1419.72s]  up towards the halfway line, Norwich are sitting deep, allowing the ball to be taken away,
[1419.72s -> 1424.36s]  allowing Manchester City to gather the ball again and mount another attack, Bernardo Silva right hand side,
[1424.36s -> 1431.48s]  Rodri behind it, Rodri gets the ball across it, it's in Tchenko, it's a good 35-40 yards from goal
[1431.48s -> 1439.72s]  onto David Silva who's come looking for it, here's Rodri under pressure from Teti but he's got the ball back towards the halfway line in Otamendi
[1439.72s -> 1445.08s]  now Jon Stokes, good ball into the path of Bernardo Silva on the right wing, comes skipping into the penalty area
[1445.32s -> 1451.64s]  Jamal Lewis goes to meet him, they've got the ball back here to Kyle Walker, Walker across to Tchenko who's 25 yards out
[1451.64s -> 1456.60s]  Sterling on the left corner of the penalty area, tackle by Byram again on Raheem Sterling and the ball runs away
[1457.32s -> 1462.52s]  would have run away from Manchester City throw in but Tchenko's decided to keep it in, here's Aguero who's dropped deep to get involved
[1462.52s -> 1469.00s]  and he finds David Silva on the edge of the area, out to the left it goes, opportunity for Sterling to swing the cross in and Tim Kool captures it
[1469.96s -> 1472.44s]  24 minutes gone, Norwich City 1-0 Manchester City
[1473.56s -> 1476.84s]  Norwich fans, you must have dreamed of this sort of situation Gossie
[1478.20s -> 1484.04s]  Even before the game started I was across on the riverside talking to the fans doing what we do in a pre-match build-up
[1484.04s -> 1489.32s]  and everyone's saying we're going to be lucky to keep them down to four or five or six, it was never going to be the case
[1489.32s -> 1494.04s]  Norwich are really doing their job well, every player is getting really close to the Man City team
[1494.12s -> 1499.48s]  and that is exactly how you stop good players from playing, you get close, touch tight, stop them playing
[1501.00s -> 1503.80s]  Ederson, the Manchester City goalkeeper, passes the ball out
[1504.36s -> 1508.84s]  I mean he's not made a save yet is he, Ederson he's just had to pick the ball out of the back of his neck from the head of Kenny McLean
[1509.24s -> 1513.48s]  Ederson's playing like a centre half, he must be about 30 yards outside his own box
[1513.48s -> 1518.36s]  Here comes Kyle Walker on the attack from Manchester City, taking on Jamal Lewis, getting the cross in and
[1519.00s -> 1524.44s]  it's cool he cuts it out at the near post, Aguero starting for the first time to look a little bit frustrated in that six yard box
[1524.92s -> 1526.60s]  but the ball's into him
[1526.60s -> 1532.44s]  but we've been not particularly accurate so far, Amadou and Godfrey have kept Aguero quiet so far
[1532.44s -> 1536.04s]  but I'll underline so far in red pen because we've only played 25 minutes and
[1537.16s -> 1541.24s]  oh that's water, back heel from Cantwell and he gets it back again from Stieperman
[1541.64s -> 1546.04s]  A showboating now Norwich City, Cantwell brings it forward on the left-hand side, it was a wonderful bit of play
[1546.44s -> 1551.24s]  from the new England under 21 international, Stieperman's being closed down, man on yells the Carrero crowd
[1551.24s -> 1557.24s]  he finds Cantwell, Cantwell goes down, no foul says the referee and Manchester City are allowed to break forward because of that with
[1557.24s -> 1561.56s]  Stoes who then is fouled by Eme Grandilla according to referee Kevin Friend
[1562.36s -> 1567.80s]  now from here and I promise this isn't Norwich bias but from here those two challenges looked pretty similar to me
[1567.80s -> 1571.00s]  Yeah they were the same challenges so if one was a foul the other one was
[1571.00s -> 1574.84s]  it ended up Man City's way but well done to Cantwell, he showed his skill there didn't he
[1574.84s -> 1580.20s]  really clever turn coming forward he certainly did, here's David Silva 25 yards out to Stirling on the left-hand side
[1580.20s -> 1583.96s]  Manchester City searching for a Carreroad equaliser, Zinchenko puts the ball into the
[1583.96s -> 1588.28s]  penalty area, two Norwich players go for it and they do enough and Teti completes the clearance
[1588.28s -> 1593.64s]  back it will come though with walk-up, it's Lewis and Cantwell both get there and then Godfrey goes
[1593.64s -> 1598.92s]  back to goalkeeper Crawl who launches the ball upfield, no chances taken there
[1598.92s -> 1604.20s]  Yeah they're growing in confidence in the Norwich side even Crawl's getting involved in it
[1604.20s -> 1610.04s]  the crowd are loving it at the moment, Man City so no problems to us, everything is going wide
[1610.04s -> 1612.68s]  we seem capable of defending their best attacks
[1614.68s -> 1620.60s]  Comes to the right wing here and Bernardo Silva on it goes to Gundogan, Gundogan's able to hold off Kenny
[1620.60s -> 1626.44s]  McLean, back it comes to Kyle Walker, Walker will give the ball to Otamendi who scored against
[1626.44s -> 1632.84s]  Norwich City in their last Premier League incarnation and here's Zinchenko on the left-hand
[1632.84s -> 1637.08s]  side, on it goes to Stirling, level with the Norwich penalty, cutting in from that left-hand side
[1637.08s -> 1642.12s]  dangerously, they're living across towards Aguero who's headed it over the bar, Manchester City
[1642.12s -> 1647.00s]  bursting to life there, brilliant from Stirling whipping that ball in onto the forehead of Aguero
[1647.00s -> 1651.24s]  and I think it almost happened in slow motion if you're a Norwich fan and you see Aguero arriving
[1651.24s -> 1656.04s]  in the six-yard box and the ball destined for his forehead and it disappeared over the bar
[1656.12s -> 1660.12s]  terrific ball in the box, not a lot Norwich could have done about that, Aguero made a brilliant run
[1660.12s -> 1665.32s]  far post, if he was a couple of inches bigger he may have got ahead on it and made it goalbound
[1665.32s -> 1670.20s]  but it didn't, it went over the bar and Norwich survived, he's scored 30 or more goals in four of the
[1670.20s -> 1675.56s]  last five seasons as Aguero so Norwich won't want to give him too many more sights like that one
[1675.56s -> 1679.24s]  but that's brilliant from Buenvilla to Stieperman and now Stieperman has released Pukki here
[1679.32s -> 1683.00s]  Norwich have got two against one, Pukki into the penalty area, it's going in for Cavlough!
[1683.00s -> 1691.56s]  It's 2-0! Norwich City have had two chances in the opening 28 minutes of this game and they've taken them both
[1692.52s -> 1699.00s]  incredible scenes here now as Cavlough punches the corner flag in celebration, what a Premier League
[1699.00s -> 1704.04s]  baptism he's having, he's scored against Chelsea, I know he's tapped in against Manchester City
[1704.04s -> 1711.00s]  after unselfish play from Timo Pukki and nobody saw this coming, Norwich City 2, Manchester City 0
[1711.80s -> 1717.00s]  that's brilliant from Norwich City, what a great counter attack and play, got a few plays involved in it
[1717.00s -> 1721.08s]  but when it did come away to Pukki I thought he was going to take it into the box and shoot
[1721.08s -> 1726.04s]  which what he would normally have done however he saw Catfell on the left hand side of it but the
[1726.04s -> 1731.96s]  simplest of tasks to pass the ball in the back of the net, this is unbelievable stuff from Norwich, unbelievable
[1733.88s -> 1737.96s]  Well they always say when you're playing against big teams when you're the underdogs you have to
[1737.96s -> 1742.20s]  take your chances and Norwich have done just that and that really opened up nicely some good
[1742.20s -> 1746.44s]  midfield play from Buenvilla and Stieperman involved and when Pukki was sent away it was
[1746.44s -> 1751.40s]  two against one, he had Catwell outside him and you were just wondering would Pukki go for goal
[1751.40s -> 1757.00s]  himself or would he square it, he made the right decision and Catwell got there and couldn't miss
[1757.00s -> 1763.32s]  really but what a couple of minutes we've had there, Aguero heading over the bar from close range and
[1763.32s -> 1769.80s]  now Todd Catwell tapping in and Norwich City lead Manchester City by two goals to nil on BBC Radio
[1769.80s -> 1776.04s]  Norfolk, we're inside the first half an hour still. Look on that attack Chris Carwalk, Otamendi,
[1776.04s -> 1780.92s]  Jones were all sucked into the centre of the goal giving Todd Catwell so much space on the
[1780.92s -> 1786.92s]  left-hand side and Pukki easy pass, I mean this is incredible from Norwich but only deserved because
[1786.92s -> 1790.28s]  Manchester City look like they're still on the team coach to be honest but that's you know that's
[1790.28s -> 1794.52s]  doing them a big group big favour at the moment the way they are playing, the pace is so slow,
[1794.52s -> 1798.92s]  it's so easy for Norwich to defend, they're pushing everything wide and when it goes wide the
[1798.92s -> 1803.96s]  defenders and full backs are stopping crosses coming in. Here's David Silva puts the ball into
[1803.96s -> 1808.04s]  the Norwich penalty area via a deflection, Amadou gets a foot on it, Byron clears the ball away
[1808.04s -> 1815.48s]  there, half an hour gone, Norwich 2 Manchester City nil at Carrow Road, here comes Bernardo
[1815.48s -> 1818.92s]  Silva though looking for something about that, McLean made a block and was taken out by his own
[1818.92s -> 1824.52s]  teammate and the ball has now fallen for Rodri 25 yards out, onto David Silva, here's Sterling
[1824.52s -> 1828.04s]  from the left edge of the box, back it goes to David Silva, high ball into the penalty area
[1828.04s -> 1831.00s]  looking for Bernardo Silva, it's headed across goal, Sterling's head is going to post!
[1833.24s -> 1837.08s]  That was an incredible bit of football there, Manchester City never really looked fully in
[1837.08s -> 1841.00s]  control of that but the ball came across, Sterling got his head to it, Krull didn't even dive, he was
[1841.00s -> 1846.76s]  beaten and the ball stumped the upright. The very first time that Byron's been caught, ball watching,
[1846.76s -> 1851.48s]  Sterling got behind him, had a free header, should have scored, hit the post. This is some game,
[1851.48s -> 1855.32s]  here's Bernardo Silva into the penalty area, he goes, gets it across, comes off the Norwich
[1855.32s -> 1860.84s]  head post but David Silva on the volley and he's scuffed it wide! Dare I say he's no Jeremy Goss
[1861.08s -> 1863.88s]  too easy with you next to me Gossie, sorry!
[1863.88s -> 1865.88s]  When it comes to volleying, Prukey's the man!
[1865.88s -> 1869.88s]  It was exactly that sort of position Gossie.
[1869.88s -> 1874.52s]  That shape reminded me of Robert Rosario so many years ago, a dip in volley on the edge of the box.
[1874.52s -> 1880.04s]  Well this is, people talk about fine margins don't they and I'm not going to say luck but you look at
[1880.04s -> 1884.68s]  the last five minutes Manchester City have gone close through Aguero, then Norwich have scored and
[1884.68s -> 1889.72s]  Sterling's hit the post but this game could quite easily be 2-1 to Man City or 2-2 couldn't it but
[1889.72s -> 1891.00s]  Norwich have got the 2-0 lead.
[1891.96s -> 1895.40s]  And I honestly think they deserve the lead because they've been really really patient
[1895.96s -> 1899.40s]  and the tactics so far have worked so very very well.
[1900.36s -> 1903.56s]  Byron playing the ball forward, it's got a deflection, he's gone out of play.
[1905.08s -> 1911.16s]  Pep's on the sidelines going a bit crazy now, Gina's team up but I can't see where they're
[1911.16s -> 1913.88s]  going to get involved or where they're going to get back, Norwich are so secure.
[1914.76s -> 1916.28s]  Is there a long way left in this game?
[1916.28s -> 1921.88s]  Well yeah, no one's getting carried away but this is quite some position, we've got to enjoy
[1921.88s -> 1925.72s]  moments like this as McLean is fouled and it's a free kick to Norwich on that right-hand side.
[1925.72s -> 1929.72s]  That's the one thing, you know that Norwich have got to keep this up for a long time because
[1929.72s -> 1935.24s]  the goals that Man City get, they've scored five or more in a game 11 times in the last year so
[1935.24s -> 1939.24s]  they are going to be a threat all afternoon but the fact that Norwich have got this two-goal buffer,
[1939.24s -> 1942.20s]  I don't imagine anybody would dare to have predicted this at this point.
[1942.20s -> 1946.36s]  No one predicted it on the on the riverside with me before the game, that's for sure they didn't.
[1946.36s -> 1950.28s]  But you've got to have faith in your team and they've done incredibly well, yes they have got
[1950.28s -> 1954.28s]  a hold out for 90 minutes but what I'm trying to say is that Man City look luck-lasting,
[1954.28s -> 1956.12s]  they don't look as though they're at it.
[1957.16s -> 1960.36s]  Free kick, Blundee swings it into the penalty area headed away by Zinchenko,
[1961.08s -> 1965.64s]  Byron's nodded it forward into space on the right wing, Puky catches up with it,
[1965.72s -> 1969.72s]  tries to step over, gets past Zinchenko and wins a corner and Norwich will fancy this,
[1969.72s -> 1973.80s]  they've already scored one goal from a corner, this is their second corner of the game.
[1974.76s -> 1978.52s]  Kenny McLean's already dumped header into the net, it's interesting to see that Amadou
[1978.52s -> 1982.44s]  despite being one of the tallest men in the Norwich team is not going forward for this.
[1983.16s -> 1986.60s]  And also interesting to see the 11 Man City players defending.
[1986.60s -> 1990.12s]  Corner from Blundee played in and Byron was nearly there, it might fall for Tetti,
[1990.12s -> 1992.76s]  appeals for handball in the penalty area as Man City scrambled it away.
[1992.84s -> 1995.72s]  Tetti appeals for handball in the penalty area as Man City scrambled it away,
[1995.72s -> 1999.72s]  Puky's shot blocked by Ultimendi and behind it goes for another corner.
[2001.08s -> 2007.00s]  Now there were real appeals from certainly the crowd and from some of the players as well
[2007.00s -> 2010.36s]  that that ball might have hit a hand and certainly I think it's Rottery as he jumps,
[2010.36s -> 2014.84s]  the ball hits him almost on the crook of the arm as he bends his arm.
[2014.84s -> 2020.44s]  I think VAR may have a look at this, it's Stones actually, it's Stones, John Stones.
[2020.60s -> 2024.20s]  It just literally rolled down his arm and that was clear and that was obvious.
[2024.20s -> 2027.80s]  Now I think we might be getting a VAR check on this, John Stones, the ball
[2029.00s -> 2033.96s]  certainly made contact with his arm, we haven't been given any messages, it looks like it's play on.
[2033.96s -> 2039.56s]  Corner, Blundee swings it into the penalty area, headed away by Manchester City, talking point there,
[2039.56s -> 2045.00s]  Amadou lifts the ball high, too high I think, no, Blundee has kept it in on the left-hand side but
[2045.00s -> 2049.72s]  was offside and the flag goes up. Well it was Stones who jumped and the ball seemed to roll down
[2049.72s -> 2053.88s]  his shoulder and the bit where you bend your arm, the inside, whatever that bit of your arm is called,
[2054.68s -> 2057.72s]  that bit of your arm that doesn't really have a name, that's where the ball seemed to land.
[2058.76s -> 2063.16s]  For me on the replay that did roll down his arm and if there was someone sat
[2063.16s -> 2068.68s]  200 miles away watching this game operating VAR then that little indication to the referee
[2068.68s -> 2072.92s]  should have been made to say have a look at this incident. Anthony Taylor is the
[2073.56s -> 2077.80s]  VAR referee, Kevin Friend is the man on the field and was clearly told that they were happy with it,
[2077.80s -> 2084.04s]  big call, great tackle from Byron on Raheem Sterling, really good opening to this game is Sam Byron
[2084.04s -> 2090.44s]  and now McLean goes forward, gets tackled, no foul given as he goes down, Orta gets the ball back to
[2090.44s -> 2095.64s]  Ederson, have Norwich been denied a penalty, Pukki was putting the penalties away in the international break
[2097.56s -> 2101.56s]  but doesn't get a chance to take one today as Aguero links up well with David Silva, the balls
[2101.56s -> 2105.96s]  on the left-hand side for Manchester City, hits Sterling in the penalty area, hits cross, cut out by Tim
[2105.96s -> 2110.52s]  Krall, 2-0 to Norwich City, 10 minutes to get a half time and with that penalty had been given
[2111.08s -> 2116.68s]  and then Pukki had scored it imagine 3-0 to Norwich. Well I'm imagining 2-0 I'm quite happy with that
[2116.68s -> 2121.40s]  one I'm not not too surprised that we're doing so well but I am surprised that Manchester City
[2121.40s -> 2125.96s]  have conceded on a set piece like they did and conceded on a counter attack and play like they
[2125.96s -> 2129.48s]  did. Well certainly in some of the tournaments in which we've seen VAR and thinking about the
[2129.48s -> 2133.88s]  World Cup last year that would have been a penalty but the Premier League have come up with this
[2133.88s -> 2137.48s]  policy that it really has to be a high bar it has to be very very obvious before they
[2138.20s -> 2142.12s]  they will change something by VAR and Norwich got away with that in the last game when Tom Tribal
[2142.12s -> 2147.88s]  and it's been admitted this week by Mike Riley the referee's chief but actually West Ham should
[2147.88s -> 2151.72s]  have had a penalty against Norwich and VAR didn't give it I wonder what he'll think about that one
[2151.72s -> 2155.56s]  anyway we can talk about that later because here come Manchester City with Roderick in the
[2155.56s -> 2161.24s]  midfield, striding forward in the carrow road sunshine shadows lengthening here's Bernardo
[2161.32s -> 2165.48s]  Silver on the right hand side Walker outside him Kyle Walker will deliver into the penalty area
[2165.48s -> 2170.04s]  beyond the penalty area oh Buendia doesn't really know what to do with it here eventually I think
[2170.04s -> 2173.80s]  he tried to head the ball out for a corner it hit him on the top of the head bounced up and Tim
[2173.80s -> 2177.32s]  Crook caught my goodness I'm gonna have to take control of this and came running out and caught
[2177.32s -> 2182.28s]  the ball. Well done again Buendia he's covering his full back really well he's not used to doing
[2182.28s -> 2186.84s]  this all this game in terms of defending defending all the time he wants to get forward he wants to
[2186.84s -> 2191.40s]  drive he wants to be an attacking player but today he's doing defensive duties very well.
[2192.04s -> 2194.76s]  Stones finds Bernardo Silver on the right hand side
[2196.68s -> 2202.20s]  Bernardo Silver will skip into the triangle of pips that is still in sunshine towards that
[2202.20s -> 2209.24s]  right hand corner flag as Man City attack and here is Gundogan once more back to John Stones
[2210.36s -> 2215.88s]  and now Zinchenko the away mid to Sterling along the ground on the left hand side Sterling
[2215.88s -> 2220.12s]  accelerates Byron does well to stay with him and eventually plays the ball off Sterling and
[2220.12s -> 2225.08s]  behind for a goal kick I've got to say Sam Byron who's had to bide his time here to make a Premier
[2225.08s -> 2228.92s]  League start for Norwich City got his chance because of the Max Ahrens injury in his first
[2228.92s -> 2233.56s]  37 minutes against Raheem Sterling he's done so well. He's having an outstanding game and I think
[2233.56s -> 2236.76s]  he's had enough of Byron because Sterling's come over to the right hand side Chris and they're
[2236.76s -> 2241.24s]  swapping flanks I thought they'd have done it a little bit earlier but he's getting no change
[2241.24s -> 2245.08s]  off of Byron he's having an excellent game he's put Sterling over to the right now.
[2245.64s -> 2251.16s]  Shajamal Lewis is delighted about that Raheem Sterling remember hit the post today eight goals
[2251.16s -> 2256.92s]  in his last seven matches for club and country but he hasn't scored this evening nobody has for
[2256.92s -> 2264.76s]  Manchester City Norwich lead this game 2-0 Kenny McLean and Todd Campwell the goal scoring heroes
[2264.76s -> 2269.96s]  for Norwich City so far still such a long way to go in the game but just to be in this position you
[2269.96s -> 2274.52s]  can only admire Norwich City and he preys on them for what they've done to get themselves to this
[2274.52s -> 2280.68s]  point here's Sinchenko on the left hand side plays the ball towards the halfway line and
[2282.20s -> 2287.88s]  Stones, Stones return to the Man City defence not going to plan at the moment but that's a good ball
[2287.88s -> 2291.88s]  for him towards Sterling who is now on the right hand side and will try across that's hit Shajamal
[2291.88s -> 2296.20s]  Lewis and gone behind and it will be a Manchester City corner and again it's all about concentration
[2297.08s -> 2302.36s]  in the words of Teddy and Krul and players like that at times like this the leaders out there
[2303.00s -> 2307.72s]  absolutely vital. Krul's got to take control again corner against Gundogan to take
[2308.68s -> 2314.12s]  they've got De Bruyne on the bench if they need it. Gundogan with the corner from the right for
[2314.12s -> 2318.36s]  Manchester City heading towards the near post David Silva got there and the ball's gone behind
[2318.36s -> 2322.28s]  for a goal kick it's quite often when you see a ball go on the ground sort of shin high towards
[2322.28s -> 2327.48s]  the near post you think well that's a poor corner but the way David Silva got there for Manchester
[2327.48s -> 2332.28s]  City I wonder whether that was planned Pep Guardiola strokes his chin. No we drilled it in near
[2332.28s -> 2338.52s]  post quite unfortunate for the Man City player they take a ricochet and go out for a goal kick
[2339.24s -> 2343.48s]  Norwich have got the confidence to take that goal kick short and Ben Godfrey will fire it
[2343.48s -> 2348.52s]  up towards the halfway line but Man City steal it and here's Kyle Walker shaving headed these days
[2348.52s -> 2354.76s]  from Spurs right back finds Ottomendi in the centre circle on again to Kyle Walker
[2354.76s -> 2358.76s]  Sterling shielding his eyes from the sun on this right hand side so Walker
[2358.76s -> 2364.12s]  opts not to give him the ball and finds Rodri in that midfield instead Rodri out to the left wing
[2365.24s -> 2369.48s]  gathered now by Bernardo Silva who's swapped sides of the pitch with Sterling
[2369.48s -> 2374.84s]  his first chance to have a go here at Buendia the back heel there allows Zinchenko to take over
[2374.84s -> 2380.04s]  and made off to Bernardo Silva and now it comes to David Silva on the corner of the
[2380.04s -> 2385.16s]  Norwich penalty area Norwich lead 2-0 under a bit of pressure here Manchester City one in black
[2385.16s -> 2389.24s]  today coming forward Buendia's working hard today and he's cut that ball out and now Tetti with
[2389.24s -> 2393.64s]  some good skill on the edge of his own box to find Steferman on the right wing Steferman tries to get
[2393.64s -> 2398.52s]  a throw in there off Zinchenko the linesman though has given that Manchester City's way and then
[2398.52s -> 2403.32s]  there's a bit of nonsense there off the ball as Zinchenko goes to pick the ball up he's gone down
[2403.40s -> 2407.48s]  as if he's been absolutely polaxed by Marco Steferman there didn't look to be a lot in that
[2407.48s -> 2412.60s]  at first glance I'm sure the VAR officials will have another look at it and decide whether
[2413.64s -> 2420.04s]  Steferman did anything naughty there but it just looked like it was a player putting his body in
[2420.04s -> 2424.20s]  the way to prevent Zinchenko from getting the ball in Zinchenko at first glance Zinchenko made
[2424.20s -> 2428.84s]  a real meal of that he did yeah he did and the embarrassing thing for him it was right in front
[2428.84s -> 2433.64s]  of his manager and Pep Guardiola he didn't even do it didn't do nothing he didn't even look at him
[2433.64s -> 2437.00s]  he just walked up and down pensively like he's doing now with his hands in his pockets
[2439.32s -> 2443.56s]  so we're seeing it again here certainly I can see why the throw in went Manchester City's way
[2443.56s -> 2447.56s]  because it hit Steferman and then oh Steferman does nothing there does he and I'll be honest
[2448.44s -> 2454.52s]  for me that type of incident is a yellow card because oh look at this Zinchenko's rattled he
[2454.52s -> 2458.60s]  nearly gave the ball away to Steferman there but Steferman with his studs couldn't quite control go
[2458.92s -> 2462.36s]  on it's the most frustrating thing in the game isn't it when a player rolls over like he's been
[2462.36s -> 2467.88s]  shot he did exactly that when there was no contact whatsoever trying to get the opposition booked
[2468.44s -> 2472.12s]  it's a disgrace and the thing is we've got VAR now so players that how they think they're going to
[2472.12s -> 2476.68s]  get away with it anyway before it goes locked from Man City Lewis cuts it out and it's gone behind
[2477.32s -> 2480.76s]  oh sorry not behind it's going to have to throw it to Man City level with the Norwich penalty
[2481.88s -> 2486.28s]  four minutes to go to half time can the Canaries hold out until half time if they can go in 2-0 up
[2486.84s -> 2490.52s]  well you really well hear the applause all around Norfolk I think from this ground at
[2490.52s -> 2495.24s]  Cairo Road in Norwich Zinchenko getting it for being booed now by the Norwich fans who
[2495.24s -> 2499.88s]  know exactly what went on there here's John Stones 25 yards out from Manchester City
[2500.68s -> 2504.44s]  just shifts it to the right and sterling important touch from Campwell the ball that has run into the
[2504.44s -> 2509.08s]  Norwich penalty area Lewis retrieves it and finds Todd Campwell who will well I said clear what he's
[2509.08s -> 2512.84s]  done is he's just shacked it into the stands but actually that'll do at this point for Norwich City
[2512.84s -> 2517.72s]  who are 2-0 up against these champions Lewis did really well there because a lot of players
[2517.72s -> 2521.56s]  with a ball watched and let sterling run behind him he didn't he didn't even look at the ball he
[2521.56s -> 2526.76s]  ran with with sterling got his body in won the ball and came out Zinchenko's got the ball you'll
[2526.76s -> 2533.08s]  know that from the reaction of the Norwich crowd after he was desperate play acting there when
[2533.08s -> 2537.32s]  Steven didn't really go anywhere near him and he threw himself to the ground what he thought he
[2537.32s -> 2541.80s]  was doing I don't know he's very fortunate not to have been booked here's Walker on the right hand
[2541.88s -> 2546.92s]  side forward from Manchester City they go back to the halfway line and stones stones will feed
[2546.92s -> 2551.80s]  Ottomendi in the centre circle Ottomendi will aim the ball out to the left and Bernardo Silva
[2552.44s -> 2559.48s]  Gundogan now has it going to want to Roderick Norwich dropping off once again as it happened
[2559.48s -> 2563.32s]  since it was nil nil but they've never had a two-goal lead to protect his John Stones long long
[2563.32s -> 2567.56s]  way out here the England defender lays the ball off here to Roderick who will play the ball out
[2567.56s -> 2571.48s]  towards the left hand side crossing opportunity for Bernardo Silva headed away by Sam Byron
[2571.48s -> 2574.92s]  drops on the edge of the penalty area though finally for Roderick perhaps the left it will
[2574.92s -> 2580.36s]  go and Bernardo Silva here is Zinchenko you'll know that for the booze and uh Steven's got the
[2580.36s -> 2585.16s]  better of him again flicking the ball up and clearing it away two minutes to halftime they're
[2585.16s -> 2591.00s]  getting no change no change at all from the Norwich back four or back seven everything is going wide
[2591.00s -> 2595.32s]  he's being stopped Byron's having an outstanding game he's already got rid of um Sterling and
[2595.32s -> 2598.92s]  sent him across the other side of the wing and it looks like he's going to be doing the same with
[2598.92s -> 2602.68s]  Silver at the moment he's having a really really good game Man City are so well drilled though
[2602.68s -> 2607.56s]  some teams at two nil down they panic don't they and the game changes but they're so well drilled
[2607.56s -> 2611.32s]  they know what they're doing it's so successful yes they've swapped the two wingers around the
[2611.32s -> 2615.24s]  style hasn't changed has it and Zinchenko's seeing plenty of the ball at the moment as I'm sure you
[2615.24s -> 2622.60s]  can tell 90 seconds to go to halftime Norwich City two nil off against Manchester City it's
[2622.60s -> 2626.20s]  extraordinary here comes Raheem Sterling on the right wing crossing low into the penalty area
[2626.20s -> 2631.00s]  McClain gets a foot to it Janal Lewis prevents the corner and puts it out of play for throwing
[2631.00s -> 2635.16s]  instead just a moment of hesitation inside the Norwich penalty area there but they weren't made
[2635.16s -> 2639.16s]  to pay Walker with the throw in from Man City would love to get one back here before halftime
[2640.28s -> 2647.00s]  here's John Stokes looking for Gundogan now Roderick in the midfield but Aguero who's
[2647.00s -> 2652.28s]  Aguero's touched the ball and Madhu for company yeah he's had one good chance he hasn't touched
[2652.36s -> 2656.36s]  the ball or game he may have had one good chance but he's dropping off 30 yards to try and pick
[2656.36s -> 2660.76s]  it up and doing something with it such as his frustration. Kyle Walker gets the ball back to
[2660.76s -> 2666.36s]  John Stokes on half way. Yellows yellows the Norwich crowd but realise I think how important it is that
[2666.36s -> 2672.52s]  they get in at halftime with that clean sheet intact Roderick turns the ball has fallen now for
[2672.52s -> 2677.56s]  Gundogan in a central position he goes past Tetti gives it to David Silva 25 yards out Zinchenko is
[2677.56s -> 2682.04s]  arriving on the corner of the area he has Bernardo Silva to take over curling across Aguero's header
[2682.04s -> 2687.56s]  and they have got one back Manchester City 30 seconds to go before halftime Aguero's had a
[2687.56s -> 2692.04s]  really really quiet game but he came to life there into the six yard box and not about falling to
[2692.04s -> 2696.60s]  the net Man City are back in it and Norwich City still have the lead Norwich 2 Manchester City 1
[2697.32s -> 2701.48s]  and he was the one for me who's got his team going again he had to drop 30 yards to get a touch and
[2701.48s -> 2707.00s]  he's shouting at his teammates and banging his hips terrific ball in got between all defenders
[2707.16s -> 2713.24s]  Norwich City is the smallest man on the pitch Aguero on the six yard line nodded in past Krull
[2715.00s -> 2719.32s]  it's a shame because Norwich really deserved to go in at 2-0 but they've snaked one back
[2719.96s -> 2723.64s]  unless hope they can just learn their lesson from that particular one it's the first time
[2723.64s -> 2729.48s]  Chris on the left hand side they've allowed across the coming of that quality goal number 238
[2730.44s -> 2735.96s]  for Sergio Aguero in a Manchester City shirt and he took it really well just to nod the ball beyond
[2736.76s -> 2741.16s]  Tim Krull and into the net and that will be frustrating for Daniel Farker and for Norwich
[2741.16s -> 2745.48s]  City but it will concentrate the minds heading up towards halftime I know what I say about 2-0
[2745.48s -> 2750.28s]  being a dangerous lead but you know 2-0 at any time against Manchester City is a fantastic position
[2750.28s -> 2756.92s]  to be in it's now 2-1 and the game's back in the balance but it just goes to show doesn't it yeah
[2756.92s -> 2761.08s]  it's opposition of this quality you can play really really well for 45 minutes
[2761.64s -> 2770.44s]  and now Byron making the challenge and dragging down that Manchester City player Bernardo Silva
[2770.44s -> 2774.04s]  who's beginning to race away from in there and we could get the game's first yellow card here
[2774.04s -> 2779.96s]  and Byron who we've been praising who's played so well is showing a yellow card there for dragging
[2779.96s -> 2784.76s]  back Bernardo Silva and Norwich have just now got to keep their heads 2-1 they lead
[2785.40s -> 2790.92s]  there's not many people that got away from Byron this half but that time he did and he kind of made
[2790.92s -> 2793.80s]  that little professional tackle knowing that he was going to make a foul
[2793.80s -> 2797.56s]  Bernardo Silva going over to the left it's worked isn't it his cross I think it was wasn't it
[2797.56s -> 2803.08s]  with Aguero headed in so 2-1 Norwich lead one minute of first half stoppage time was signalled
[2803.08s -> 2808.68s]  and we must have just about had that already as we get ready to watch Gundogan swing a free kick
[2808.68s -> 2813.40s]  towards that Norwich penalty area with the right foot from wide left it's high in the penalty area
[2813.72s -> 2818.60s]  it's headed down should be away by Pukki and that will bring to an end quite a first half at
[2818.60s -> 2823.00s]  Carrow Road the champions of the championship are leading the champions of the Premier League by
[2823.00s -> 2828.44s]  two goals to one yellows yellows Chantler-Moray City crowd have enjoyed themselves in that first
[2828.44s -> 2835.32s]  half so so much the Canaries defending stoutly defending resolutely not taking any chances
[2835.32s -> 2839.96s]  really playing smartly in the first 20 minutes or so and then taking the lead
[2839.96s -> 2844.28s]  incredibly corner from Buendia Norwich's first of the game headed in by Kenny McLean one nil
[2844.28s -> 2847.96s]  and then Dreamland 11 minutes later a Norwich break two against one
[2847.96s -> 2853.56s]  Timo Pukki rolling the ball across and Todd Hanwell taps it two nil Norwich City were unexpectedly
[2853.56s -> 2857.88s]  in control of the game Manchester City had gone close a couple of times Sterling hit opposed
[2857.88s -> 2862.20s]  Aguero headed one over the bar but just at the end of that first half Aguero coming to life
[2862.20s -> 2867.72s]  heading in from close range 2-1 the half-time score well the Norwich players are about to come
[2867.72s -> 2873.88s]  back out onto the pitch and this could be a very very big 45 minutes for City they are beating the
[2873.88s -> 2880.12s]  champions by two goals to one let's hand back now to our commentary team Norwich City legend Jeremy
[2880.12s -> 2885.16s]  Goss and of course Chris Gorham. Norwich City have won the first half we'll say that with tongue in
[2885.16s -> 2889.00s]  cheek because a lot of people were joking when we said they won the second half against Liverpool
[2889.00s -> 2893.64s]  well they've taken the first half against Manchester City and there is something in that
[2893.64s -> 2898.52s]  Gossy because whatever happens from here a lot of fans before the game were saying look I just
[2898.52s -> 2902.04s]  don't want Norwich to be absolutely battered today I just want to even if they lose I want them to
[2902.04s -> 2905.08s]  have something to take from the game well they've already got that haven't they I mean they're in a
[2905.08s -> 2909.00s]  winning position they could go on and win this game but whatever happens from here they've given
[2909.00s -> 2912.12s]  the fans they've given themselves something to get the team into haven't they?
[2912.12s -> 2916.68s]  Exactly right and just like the Liverpool picture everyone thought that it was going to be a walk
[2916.68s -> 2920.76s]  over for Liverpool but it wasn't we came away from Anfield our heads held high
[2920.76s -> 2925.24s]  it was a respectable performance we competed incredibly well we won the second half and that
[2925.24s -> 2930.28s]  boosted the confidence going into the Newcastle fixture this likewise I think the team have done
[2930.28s -> 2935.48s]  incredibly well on their defensive duties and they've done incredibly well going forward to score
[2935.48s -> 2940.28s]  two goals the trick is and the question is can they maintain that for the next 45 minutes?
[2940.28s -> 2944.68s]  Second half has started Manchester City chasing an equalizer get us underway in their all-black
[2944.68s -> 2949.40s]  strip no changes made by either head coach or the coach of the team
[2950.28s -> 2954.12s]  head coach at half time and Norwich straight away winner a throw in their left back position as
[2954.12s -> 2958.60s]  Jamal Lewis plays the ball off Raheem Sterling Kenny McLean launches the ball away for Norwich
[2958.60s -> 2962.92s]  it bounces towards the halfway line and David Silva heads the ball back into his own half
[2962.92s -> 2967.16s]  well reminds you of the team lineups in a moment for those just switching on if you are just
[2967.16s -> 2972.36s]  switching on you might not believe this it's Norwich City 2 Manchester City 1 goals from
[2972.36s -> 2977.80s]  McLean and Campwell had Norwich 2-0 up Aguero hitting back right on the stroke of half time
[2977.96s -> 2981.64s]  that will have given Manchester City something to get their teeth into and here's Bernardo Silva
[2981.64s -> 2986.68s]  on the left-hand side looking for the edge of the box cut out by Amadou on his Cairo debut but it's
[2986.68s -> 2990.68s]  come back for Bernardo Silva on the left he's gone past Buendia he's got a crossing opportunity
[2990.68s -> 2995.32s]  and it comes headed away by Godfrey Kyle Walker with a little header though back to John Stones
[2996.04s -> 2999.80s]  the man said he looked for some joy on the right hand side with Sterling who hit the post in the
[2999.80s -> 3005.16s]  first half here's Raheem Sterling again on the right wing swap wings with Bernardo Silva late
[3005.16s -> 3009.24s]  in the first half and it's good effect because it was Bernardo Silva's cross that Aguero headed in
[3009.24s -> 3014.76s]  here's Ottomendi coming forward from Man City driven out to the left and Bernardo Silva Bernardo
[3014.76s -> 3018.60s]  Silva bearing down on the edge of the Norwich penalty area crossing from that left-hand side
[3018.60s -> 3023.00s]  Amadou's looping header away Rodri puts it back into the penalty area Amadou there again
[3023.00s -> 3028.92s]  Steeperman there to hook the ball away from Norwich City Kyle Walker gathers plays it to
[3028.92s -> 3033.00s]  Ottomendi on halfway everyone back behind the ball to Norwich already and we've only played 90
[3033.00s -> 3037.08s]  seconds of the second half here's Bernardo Silva playing the ball on here for Aguero to run onto
[3037.08s -> 3041.72s]  in the penalty area a sliding Amadou clearing the ball away and it's gone out of play from
[3041.72s -> 3047.80s]  Manchester City throw-in just down below us on their left Boos for Zinchenko who wasn't booked
[3047.80s -> 3053.32s]  in the first half despite some very obvious play acting after well I'm not going to say a clash
[3053.32s -> 3058.12s]  with Steeperman because it wasn't a clash here comes Stones rolling the ball to the right wing
[3058.20s -> 3065.64s]  gathered now by Sterling Kyle Walker joins the attack Walker plays it to Rodri here onto Zinchenko
[3065.64s -> 3070.28s]  35 yards or so out to Bernardo Silva on the left-hand side here's Aguero on the edge of the box
[3070.28s -> 3074.12s]  Buendia comes to life in the Norwich right back position here he's got through so much hard work
[3074.12s -> 3077.88s]  in this game already and tries to win a throw in there for his team but the ball just won't go out
[3077.88s -> 3083.16s]  of play Sam Byron then hacks it away headed inside by Zinchenko Norwich are capped on the edge of
[3083.16s -> 3087.64s]  their own penalty area here McLean does really well to get them out of trouble finding Jamal
[3087.64s -> 3092.76s]  Lewis on the left-hand side Lewis holds on to the ball then tries to squeeze it forward to
[3092.76s -> 3096.84s]  Campwell but it's going to take it and Rikishan falls kindly for Rodri Manchester City as you
[3096.84s -> 3101.56s]  would expect 2-1 down dominating the possession Zinchenko looking again for Bernardo Silva on
[3101.56s -> 3106.12s]  this left-hand side Bernardo Silva towards the corner of the penalty area everyone's still back
[3106.12s -> 3113.24s]  for Norwich here's Zinchenko again to Bernardo Silva back it comes to David Silva now and David
[3113.24s -> 3117.08s]  Silva played that one almost behind Zinchenko but the Ukrainian catches up with the ball
[3117.08s -> 3120.84s]  he'll be booed every time he touches it for the foreseeable future by the Norwich fans who
[3120.84s -> 3124.84s]  weren't impressed with his antics in the first half now John Stones comes forward with the ball
[3124.84s -> 3129.56s]  his feet for Manchester City feeds Sterling on the right-hand side plenty of yellow shirts back
[3129.56s -> 3134.68s]  looking to keep their discipline Raheem Sterling can't find a way through gives it to Kyle Walker
[3134.68s -> 3139.88s]  back now to Rodri onto David Silva 20 yards out David Silva finds Bernardo Silva his first time
[3139.96s -> 3144.92s]  cross is cut out by the impressive Sam Byron Byron takes his time but eventually clears the
[3144.92s -> 3149.32s]  ball away Norwich have crawling goal Byron Godfrey Amadou and Lewis at the back Tetic McLean and
[3149.32s -> 3153.32s]  Steeperman in midfield Rondier and Campwell playing either side of Pukian attack and a
[3153.32s -> 3157.40s]  poor pass there from Manchester City but Norwich have stolen it and Pukian and Steeperman exchange
[3157.40s -> 3161.32s]  passes and Pukian sent running away into the penalty area in front of the Barclay and he's
[3161.32s -> 3167.56s]  put the ball just wide that was just like the second goal that Norwich got where they pounced
[3167.64s -> 3172.20s]  on it a mistake in the midfield set Pukian away that time he was able to square to Campwell this
[3172.20s -> 3176.68s]  time he was just a little wide tried to roll the ball into the corner of the net but didn't strike
[3176.68s -> 3181.56s]  it with enough conviction and let off the Manchester City. Otamendi and Jones having a bit of a nightmare
[3181.56s -> 3186.36s]  there Steeperman picked it up really really quickly first time Rondier has stolen the ball from Otamendi
[3186.36s -> 3192.04s]  in the penalty area plays it to Pukian this is a great chance this three-one a defensive blunder at
[3192.60s -> 3200.20s]  the back from Manchester City Otamendi was robbed by his fellow Argentinian Rondier and Rondier put that one on a play for
[3200.20s -> 3205.24s]  Timo Pukian and the Premier League's player of the month gobbled it up in front of the Barclay
[3205.24s -> 3209.32s]  and Norwich City well this is getting better and better five minutes into the second half
[3209.32s -> 3214.68s]  it's Norwich City three Manchester City one. Otamendi must be in shock there
[3215.24s -> 3218.92s]  often have you seen already the season before being played from the goalkeeper
[3218.92s -> 3226.28s]  and a key four session inside the area and it's been given away quite simple ball comes across to
[3226.28s -> 3233.40s]  Pukian missed the first opportunity but didn't miss the second. Well there were there was talk
[3233.40s -> 3239.80s]  before this game about that Amric Laporte missing from Manchester City and how their defence might
[3239.80s -> 3245.96s]  miss him and my goodness that was terrible from Manchester City awful Otamendi dallyed on the ball
[3245.96s -> 3250.76s]  Rondier stole it from him squared it to Pukian Pukian had the composer to actually take a touch
[3250.76s -> 3256.92s]  six yards out and then gleefully rifled it into an empty Barclay and net and Norwich City are three
[3256.92s -> 3262.20s]  one up against Manchester City absolutely extraordinary it is it is extraordinary
[3262.20s -> 3265.88s]  because Manchester City started the game very very well especially down this left hand side with
[3265.88s -> 3273.88s]  Bernardo Silva however Norwich have just stolen stolen a goal a gift given to them by Man City
[3274.44s -> 3277.56s]  corner given to Man City at the other end as Aguero is tackled by McClain
[3277.56s -> 3280.76s]  Norwich were protesting they thought it should have been a goal kick corner it is
[3282.04s -> 3287.80s]  what a 40 minutes we've got here now on BBC Radio Norwich League 3-1 against Manchester City
[3287.80s -> 3291.32s]  and they've got a corner to defend here which will be taken by Gundogan on the right hand side
[3291.32s -> 3295.64s]  played into the penalty area now Otamendi's got a looping header to that one and it's going to drop
[3295.64s -> 3302.44s]  wide Otamendi has got some amends to make here because well Rondier burgled him in the penalty area
[3303.00s -> 3307.64s]  and you cannot believe a team that's been champions for the last two years is making
[3307.64s -> 3311.96s]  mistakes like that I was just going to say how much does this team cost to assemble
[3311.96s -> 3319.00s]  how good are these set-up backs keep raving about how great they are that was a gift and it was a
[3319.00s -> 3324.20s]  schoolboy error and Pep Guardiola looked shocked on the bench just sat down looking at his own
[3324.20s -> 3329.96s]  shaft thinking what do I do next well De Bruyne, Jesus and Mahrez are there they might have an idea
[3329.96s -> 3335.88s]  for it 3-1 Norwich City lead and Carrow Road we've just had a rendition of On The Ball City that I'm
[3335.88s -> 3340.36s]  sure you heard by and Jerry Grosta which was as loud as any I've heard at Carrow Road for some time
[3340.36s -> 3345.08s]  and we've had some wonderful atmospheres here over the last 12 months or so but Norwich fans
[3345.88s -> 3351.72s]  they know that what they're seeing here is completely unexpected and it's a joy to behold
[3351.72s -> 3354.76s]  they are beating Manchester City 3-1 in a Premier League game
[3357.32s -> 3362.36s]  and the thing is as good as Manchester City are going forward the way they've defended today
[3362.36s -> 3364.68s]  Norwich have scored three goals from four chances really
[3366.28s -> 3371.00s]  Amadou really giving the ball away to Bernardo Silva Aguero heads it into the box blocked by Godfrey
[3371.00s -> 3375.56s]  comes back to Aguero who tries an ambitious volley and it took an affliction goes over the bar and a
[3375.56s -> 3380.28s]  corner it is but a rare mistake at the back there from Ibrahim Amadou who as a midfielder playing as
[3380.76s -> 3386.52s]  standing centre-back seems like when you go three one up like that it seems to put pressure on you
[3386.52s -> 3392.20s]  as the team winning we've just got to remain calm in these situations make the right decision at the
[3392.20s -> 3398.60s]  right time corner played short to Bernardo Silva back now to Zinchenko 25 yards out Zinchenko gets
[3398.60s -> 3403.08s]  the earliest feet and onto Kyle Walker Walker Pobel that's going to go behind for a goal here
[3403.08s -> 3408.84s]  and Carrow Road cheers that almost like a goal because they know that this is a some position
[3408.84s -> 3412.28s]  Norwich have got themselves in I wonder what Daniel Farker is thinking as he strokes his chin
[3412.28s -> 3416.28s]  over on that far side of the pitch the Norwich City head coach with that black coat on
[3416.28s -> 3419.80s]  then it would give me the Man City line-up so much has happened since half-time Edison in goal
[3419.80s -> 3424.84s]  Walker-Stones, Ottomendis, Zinchenko the defenders, Wadrick Gundeman and David Silva in midfield
[3424.84s -> 3430.20s]  Bernardo Silva now playing on the left Sterling on the right Aguero has scored he's up front for them
[3430.76s -> 3433.16s]  3-1 to Norwich City against Manchester City
[3433.16s -> 3435.16s]  on the right side of the pitch
[3435.16s -> 3439.16s]  Jamal Lewis plays the ball forward takes a deflection that goes out of play
[3439.16s -> 3443.16s]  and well in fact it hasn't taken a deflection it's gone Manchester City's way
[3445.16s -> 3453.16s]  here's John Stones for City who actually could easily have been penalised for a ham ball in the penalty area in the first half let's not forget that
[3453.16s -> 3455.16s]  Zinchenko for Man City
[3455.16s -> 3458.16s]  onto David Silva in his last season with Man City
[3458.16s -> 3464.16s]  forward he comes Bernardo Silva on the left cuts it back now to Aguero has come out to the left wing to get involved onto Zinchenko
[3464.16s -> 3468.16s]  could be staring in his first ever Premier League defeat today here's Aguero on the edge of the box
[3468.16s -> 3473.16s]  oh Buendia makes a great challenge there and Cantwell can't quite clear the ball away
[3473.16s -> 3477.16s]  Steeperman can he puts it up towards the halfway line and Puky's up again here
[3477.16s -> 3483.16s]  Puky battles with Zinchenko holds him off nicely there does Timur Puky and then back it goes to Byron
[3483.16s -> 3488.16s]  who plays it in field to Tetti and Tetti sort of hips the ball through towards Steeperman who can't get there
[3488.16s -> 3492.16s]  gathered by John Stones Norwich City 3 Manchester City 1
[3492.16s -> 3497.16s]  I'm almost giving out the score a bit more often this evening just to convince myself that this is really happening
[3497.16s -> 3502.16s]  here's Walker on the right hand side Sterling in front of him now Sterling sets off
[3502.16s -> 3506.16s]  cutting in dangerously gives the ball to Gundogan Gundogan's got it to David Silva
[3506.16s -> 3510.16s]  onto Aguero who goes into the penalty area and gets tackled by a sliding and a committed Ben Godfrey
[3510.16s -> 3516.16s]  and it's hacked away by Cantwell and Norwich City have still got a full 35 minutes of this game to get through
[3516.16s -> 3519.16s]  but they lead 3-1 and they are going to give this everything
[3519.16s -> 3526.16s]  Zinchenko on halfway Byron this time the challenge there he's got to be careful
[3526.16s -> 3531.16s]  Bernardo Silva's crossed from the left it's hit Amadou it might fall in the penalty area for Sterling with the header
[3531.16s -> 3535.16s]  it's gathered by Tim Krall and there was a foul there by Byron in that move
[3535.16s -> 3538.16s]  there's the referee played advantage Byron is on a yellow card
[3538.16s -> 3542.16s]  and he's going to come under fierce pressure for the rest of this game you know that
[3542.16s -> 3544.16s]  yeah as all the players are
[3544.16s -> 3549.16s]  but now Man City have stepped the game up Chris you can see that they're going faster with the ball
[3549.16s -> 3553.16s]  they're moving it quicker they're driving down this left hand side in particular that's a danger
[3553.16s -> 3559.16s]  but Norwich have got to stay calm and stay composed and do what they'd normally do when they defend the ball
[3559.16s -> 3562.16s]  Cantwell now plays the ball forward Cookie setting off again here
[3562.16s -> 3565.16s]  it doesn't go up and the ball has gone through to the penalty area for Edison anyway
[3565.16s -> 3568.16s]  I mean this is the thing Man City are going to pile the pressure on
[3568.16s -> 3572.16s]  but the way this game has gone Norwich have pinched three goals on the break really haven't they
[3572.16s -> 3576.16s]  they haven't had many chances and you feel that they may get more
[3576.16s -> 3580.16s]  here's Zinchenko on the left to Bernardo Silva oh lovely takes the ball away from Buendía
[3580.16s -> 3583.16s]  who's had a really good game today Buendía already
[3583.16s -> 3589.16s]  onto Zinchenko now on the left hand side David Silva gathers plays it back to Zinchenko into the area helped on
[3589.16s -> 3593.16s]  then to David Silva who will cross fiercely from the left hand side good header from Byron
[3593.16s -> 3597.16s]  Cantwell just about gets enough on the ball to smuggle it away from the penalty area
[3597.16s -> 3599.16s]  De Bruyne I think is about to come on
[3599.16s -> 3602.16s]  yeah we expect these subs to come on now
[3602.16s -> 3607.16s]  Pep Guardiola is not going to be happy with this the way the performance is going at the moment for Man City
[3607.16s -> 3611.16s]  the game continues those Zinchenko 30 yards out gets the ball back from Gundogan
[3611.16s -> 3616.16s]  and now it goes towards John Stones forward will come Stones looking for Sterling on the right
[3616.16s -> 3621.16s]  away from Sterling and can't control and he's gone out for a throw in Man City have got a game at Shakhtar Deneck
[3621.16s -> 3626.16s]  in the Champions League on Wednesday they probably would have preferred to have given players like De Bruyne
[3626.16s -> 3630.16s]  a little bit more time off tonight but they're going to have to bring him on because
[3630.16s -> 3637.16s]  Gundogan is being replaced here by Kevin De Bruyne who is quite a player to be able to bring on in any circumstances
[3637.16s -> 3644.16s]  just changes things for Norwich again and they're also taking off David Silva to bring on Gabriel Jesus
[3644.16s -> 3651.16s]  so Gundogan going off, David Silva going off and on will come De Bruyne and Jesus
[3651.16s -> 3654.16s]  that's quite a combination coming onto the pitch now
[3654.16s -> 3658.16s]  yeah and let's see if it does make a difference but at the moment these really expensive Man City players
[3658.16s -> 3664.16s]  have no effect on the Norwich side who are compact they stay close together they're working as a team
[3664.16s -> 3669.16s]  they're not panicking at the moment and they really really deserve to be this 3-1-0
[3670.16s -> 3675.16s]  De Bruyne is on, a forward teammate of Tim Closer back in his Wolfsburg days
[3675.16s -> 3680.16s]  I'm sure Closer will be really disappointed he hasn't got the chance to go toe to toe with him on the pitch today
[3680.16s -> 3685.16s]  but he'll be so proud watching on as his teammates have taken a 3-1 lead against Manchester City
[3685.16s -> 3689.16s]  but here's Sinchenko straight away looking for Rodri away from Teti
[3689.16s -> 3693.16s]  Rodri up to the edge of the penalty area here plays it there to Aguero who gets the ball out of his feet
[3693.16s -> 3698.16s]  and will get the shot in eventually and it's charged out by Buendia and behind for a Manchester City corner
[3698.16s -> 3703.16s]  it was charged down by three or four yellow shirts then no opportunity to get a shot on target
[3703.16s -> 3708.16s]  well done Norwich again and this is what I'm saying stay compact bring your teammate close to you
[3708.16s -> 3711.16s]  don't let any gaps appear between you and the strikers
[3711.16s -> 3715.16s]  and they've now got De Bruyne on the set pieces which is a different threat altogether
[3715.16s -> 3719.16s]  the Belgian gets ready with this corner from the left hand side for Manchester City
[3719.16s -> 3724.16s]  plays it into the Norwich area now good delivery and oh my goodness Otamendi was a whisker away from getting on the end of it
[3724.16s -> 3728.16s]  but Stieperman did enough he got his head to it and has guided that one out of play
[3728.16s -> 3734.16s]  and Stieperman is the first to be clapping and G and his teammates up to stay strong and stay composed
[3734.16s -> 3739.16s]  it was a terrific delivery it was only a corner but you can see the class in De Bruyne and the way he's set pieces on
[3739.16s -> 3743.16s]  Manchester City have won all of their last nine away games in the Premier League
[3743.16s -> 3746.16s]  and here they are 3-1 down to Norwich with almost an hour played
[3746.16s -> 3749.16s]  De Bruyne has gone the width of the pitch and will take this corner from the right this time
[3749.16s -> 3751.16s]  whipped in dangerously headed away by McClay
[3751.16s -> 3755.16s]  Pukic can't complete the clearance though and Bernardo's silver shot is then blocked
[3755.16s -> 3759.16s]  and Norwich get it a little bit further away from goal this time
[3759.16s -> 3763.16s]  and McClay had a dress rehearsal on Monday night he was in the Scotland team beating 4-0 by Belgium
[3763.16s -> 3767.16s]  I think De Bruyne was involved in all four goals that Belgium scored
[3767.16s -> 3771.16s]  Sterling breaks into the penalty area here gets beyond Krul but can't quite work it goalwards
[3771.16s -> 3775.16s]  I think Krul might have just got a touch on that and behind it goes for a corner
[3775.16s -> 3780.16s]  Norwich you can just sense Norwich are just trying to get a handle on what Manchester City have done with their system here
[3780.16s -> 3782.16s]  they're just reorganising a little bit aren't they
[3782.16s -> 3786.16s]  It's the brilliance of De Bruyne he's put a 30-yard diagonal ball into the box past Norwich there
[3786.16s -> 3789.16s]  another corner Norwich lead 3-1 but they're defending a corner
[3789.16s -> 3791.16s]  De Bruyne delivers curling towards the end of the 6-yard box
[3791.16s -> 3792.16s]  Steekman heads it away again
[3792.16s -> 3797.16s]  Pulsar Zinchenko on now for Bernardo's silver who worked it to the right-hand side
[3797.16s -> 3802.16s]  De Bruyne has driven cross comes off a Norwich player and then Ben Godfrey has worked that one away so firmly
[3802.16s -> 3806.16s]  It's actually struck the roof of the River End stand on its way behind for a corner
[3806.16s -> 3810.16s]  They are defending manfully here in Norwich City but they've got plenty more of it to get through
[3812.16s -> 3816.16s]  Corner De Bruyne again from the right-hand side
[3817.16s -> 3823.16s]  Kehl towards the edge of the penalty area this time it's a poor one and Amadou has run outside the penalty area to head it away
[3823.16s -> 3828.16s]  and then Kyle Walker gives Ederson a difficult back pass but Ederson the goalkeeper is standing 40 yards from goal
[3828.16s -> 3832.16s]  and is able to bring it under control and release Bernardo's silver
[3832.16s -> 3835.16s]  Bernardo's silver now to that right-hand side and it is De Bruyne
[3835.16s -> 3838.16s]  De Bruyne already putting a ball into the penalty area Godfrey cuts it out
[3838.16s -> 3841.16s]  Bernardo's silver gets the shot in it's blocked
[3841.16s -> 3845.16s]  It's headed back towards the penalty area Byron emerges to head the ball away
[3845.16s -> 3848.16s]  Here's Rodri from Manchester City wide to the right and De Bruyne
[3848.16s -> 3854.16s]  De Bruyne calls in another ball that Godfrey belly flops and throws himself to hit the ball away once more
[3854.16s -> 3857.16s]  Jamal Lewis battling with De Bruyne it's out of play throw in
[3857.16s -> 3861.16s]  Man City get on with it they're chasing the game they're 3-1 down at Carrow Road
[3861.16s -> 3868.16s]  Here's Zinchenko 35 yards plus out back to Ottomendi and now John Stones
[3868.16s -> 3871.16s]  Stones will play the ball on to Kyle Walker
[3871.16s -> 3875.16s]  Walker hits it an ambitious diagonal here over the head of Bernardo's silver
[3875.16s -> 3879.16s]  Another play for a throw in and Norwich City withstand the spell of Manchester City pressure
[3879.16s -> 3883.16s]  and there'll be plenty more of those but how hard have Norwich worked?
[3883.16s -> 3884.16s]  They're putting everything on the line here
[3884.16s -> 3888.16s]  They're working so hard now's the time to kill the game off kill the pace of the game off
[3888.16s -> 3891.16s]  Slow the tempo down take your time on throw ins
[3891.16s -> 3894.16s]  Set pieces, goal kicks, take your time
[3899.16s -> 3902.16s]  Ottomendi launching one forward for Manchester City, Norwich lead 3-1
[3902.16s -> 3905.16s]  Steakman gets the better of Rodri seems to get a foot on the ball
[3905.16s -> 3910.16s]  but the referee says free kick they've taken it quickly they've taken it quickly Manchester City
[3910.16s -> 3915.16s]  and the referee was still has a couple of Norwich players in his face so tells him to go back and take it again
[3915.16s -> 3919.16s]  Norwich City 3, Manchester City 1 at Carrow Road, McLean, Kempwell and Pukki
[3919.16s -> 3924.16s]  on what could be a famous night for Norwich City supporters still half an hour to play
[3924.16s -> 3929.16s]  De Bruyne stands now with his hands on his hips, number 17 on his back
[3929.16s -> 3933.16s]  Wonderful player had such an injury hit season last year
[3933.16s -> 3937.16s]  has come back this season and has been like a new signing for Manchester City
[3937.16s -> 3939.16s]  He's had a really good start to the season
[3939.16s -> 3944.16s]  Guardiola has had to put him on to try and get his team back into the game
[3944.16s -> 3948.16s]  De Bruyne's free kick, decent delivery and it nearly bounced all the way through
[3948.16s -> 3952.16s]  Krul saw it late but catches it and Tim Krul rolls to the floor there
[3952.16s -> 3955.16s]  Delightful really with the ball in his hands
[3955.16s -> 3961.16s]  Talk about quality already that's five really effective balls that De Bruyne has whipped into the penalty box
[3961.16s -> 3963.16s]  including the corners, including that free kick
[3963.16s -> 3965.16s]  Well done Krul, he kept his eye on that
[3965.16s -> 3969.16s]  anticipating a little touch off one of the strikers, never came
[3969.16s -> 3974.16s]  followed the ball down, gathered it in his arms and we can take our time again and try and kill the game off again
[3974.16s -> 3977.16s]  It's gone back to Godfrey in the Norwich left back position
[3977.16s -> 3981.16s]  Talk about a dilemma that Daniel Falker might have in a moment
[3981.16s -> 3984.16s]  as Manchester City launch a high ball forward from Stones there
[3984.16s -> 3986.16s]  Godfrey slightly misjudging the bounce against Aguero
[3986.16s -> 3988.16s]  but recovers and heads it back to Tim Krul
[3988.16s -> 3991.16s]  Now Daniel Falker has got Grant Hanley on the bench today
[3991.16s -> 3995.16s]  He's a recognised defender, who he said he thought he could get 20 minutes half an hour out of if he needed him
[3995.16s -> 3999.16s]  But if you bring him on, and try and shore it up a little bit
[3999.16s -> 4002.16s]  you almost disrupt what's gone so well don't you up to now
[4002.16s -> 4005.16s]  No I agree, I agree I think we should just take it as it is at the moment
[4005.16s -> 4009.16s]  Norwich though I'm sure the legs will get tired, they've done so much running
[4009.16s -> 4013.16s]  It's a foul by McLean on Roderick but the referee will allow play to continue
[4013.16s -> 4016.16s]  because Manchester City have good possession with Raheem Sterling on the right wing
[4016.16s -> 4020.16s]  Raheem Sterling now takes on Jamal Lewis who makes a good challenge
[4020.16s -> 4023.16s]  Great well-timed challenge from the Norwich left back and it's a corner
[4023.16s -> 4026.16s]  We're seeing a real series of these corners now
[4026.16s -> 4029.16s]  and Kenny McLean has got a yellow card to go with the goal
[4029.16s -> 4032.16s]  but he got it in the first half and I don't think he can have too many complaints about that
[4032.16s -> 4036.16s]  How long Roderick is the sort of challenge that you normally see yellow cards given for
[4037.16s -> 4038.16s]  Another corner
[4038.16s -> 4040.16s]  There's a willingness there isn't there
[4040.16s -> 4044.16s]  These midfield players and Norwich today have been brilliant the way they've closed and chased and shielded the ball
[4045.16s -> 4047.16s]  Corner number 10 for Manchester City
[4047.16s -> 4050.16s]  De Bruyne to take on the right hand side delivered towards the penalty spot
[4050.16s -> 4053.16s]  Godfrey powers the header away 3-1 Norwich lead
[4053.16s -> 4055.16s]  They're under pressure here, serious pressure
[4055.16s -> 4058.16s]  Zinchenko plays the ball to Bernardo Silva
[4058.16s -> 4062.16s]  Bernardo Silva the Portuguese player rolls it to the right hand side and De Bruyne who delivers
[4062.16s -> 4066.16s]  Gabriel Jesus jumps, Byron gets the better of him headed away by Canva
[4067.16s -> 4070.16s]  Back it comes to Zinchenko on the left hand side
[4071.16s -> 4074.16s]  And it's Sterling tied to the touchline on the left wing
[4074.16s -> 4078.16s]  It's a Zinchenko who lifts the ball into the area and Byron just stands
[4078.16s -> 4080.16s]  Firm footed and heads the ball away
[4080.16s -> 4084.16s]  And now Steakman with a chance to just bring the ball forward for the first time in a while
[4084.16s -> 4086.16s]  And they're going to throw it to Norwich City
[4087.16s -> 4090.16s]  They're going to make a change, Manchester City, I think Zinchenko's got to come off
[4090.16s -> 4092.16s]  He's had a real shocker today
[4092.16s -> 4096.16s]  Including the elaborate dive profile that never really was in the first half
[4096.16s -> 4098.16s]  Crowd are always having a go at him
[4099.16s -> 4102.16s]  Rodney has just been dispossessed on halfway by Bernardo Silva who comes sprinting forward
[4102.16s -> 4105.16s]  Amadou with a good touch to get the ball away from Aguero and it's a throw in
[4105.16s -> 4108.16s]  He's got to Joe Cancello on the bench
[4108.16s -> 4111.16s]  The Portuguese left back if he wants to take Zinchenko off
[4111.16s -> 4114.16s]  But he can only make one more change, Pep Guardiola
[4114.16s -> 4118.16s]  This team are 3-1 down at Carreirova, still 25 minutes to go
[4118.16s -> 4124.16s]  Ottomendi finds stones, played again to Ottomendi who was badly at fault for Norwich's third goal
[4125.16s -> 4128.16s]  Tackled by Buendia and he put it on the plate for Pukki
[4129.16s -> 4131.16s]  And that's why Norwich lead 3-1
[4131.16s -> 4134.16s]  Here's Kyle Walker, gives the ball to Ottomendi
[4134.16s -> 4139.16s]  Ottomendi drives a firm pass along the ground to Bernardo Silva on the left-hand side
[4139.16s -> 4142.16s]  As Manchester City attack the river end, going right to left
[4142.16s -> 4145.16s]  The sun just dropping down behind that river end stand now
[4145.16s -> 4148.16s]  Walker puts the ball towards the edge of the penalty area
[4148.16s -> 4150.16s]  The Norwich fans are going through every kick with their team here
[4151.16s -> 4154.16s]  Here's Kyle Walker, onto Roderick, Man City come again
[4154.16s -> 4157.16s]  De Bruyne on the right wing, whips another dangerous ball in and there's Amadou
[4157.16s -> 4159.16s]  All action, heading the ball away
[4159.16s -> 4162.16s]  They're ending up on the floor having done so
[4162.16s -> 4165.16s]  But they just made sure Aguero couldn't get on the end of it
[4165.16s -> 4167.16s]  Now Kyle Walker looks again for the run over
[4167.16s -> 4170.16s]  De Bruyne who's got space and brings it into the Norwich penalty area from the right-hand side
[4170.16s -> 4172.16s]  Just got it stuck under his feet there for a moment now
[4172.16s -> 4174.16s]  And the ball's run behind for a goal kick
[4174.16s -> 4176.16s]  A rare mistake from Kevin De Bruyne
[4176.16s -> 4181.16s]  Well that was, appeared the worst there but Lewis stood his ground
[4181.16s -> 4185.16s]  De Bruyne actually fell over on the ball in the end but he's shown his class
[4185.16s -> 4188.16s]  But we're capable and we're coping with this pressure very well Chris
[4188.16s -> 4191.16s]  Everybody is doing their job incredibly well
[4191.16s -> 4195.16s]  And now's the time again once again just to keep it and kill the pace of the game
[4195.16s -> 4199.16s]  Man City are high pressing, you never know, we could even get another chance to score
[4199.16s -> 4203.16s]  Teddy plays the ball into the left back position where Kenny McLean is waiting for it
[4203.16s -> 4205.16s]  Back to Godfrey in his own area
[4205.16s -> 4208.16s]  Godfrey passing the ball to Buendia, one touch back to Teddy
[4208.16s -> 4211.16s]  Norwich perhaps over-complicating things deep inside their own half
[4211.16s -> 4212.16s]  And they've given the ball away
[4212.16s -> 4215.16s]  And here's Gabriel Jesus, he'll be desperate to get involved here
[4215.16s -> 4217.16s]  But Buendia's tattered him really well
[4217.16s -> 4219.16s]  And now Pukki chest it down to Campwell
[4219.16s -> 4221.16s]  And here comes a Norwich counter-attack
[4221.16s -> 4223.16s]  First time they've gone forward since the third goal
[4223.16s -> 4225.16s]  Here's Buendia, halfway inside the Manchester City half
[4225.16s -> 4227.16s]  Stiepman in acres of space and arriving
[4227.16s -> 4229.16s]  And with the ball at his feet now, edge of the penalty
[4229.16s -> 4231.16s]  And Marco Stiepman gets it through to Pukki
[4231.16s -> 4234.16s]  And it might run for Stiepman, no, an important touch at the back there
[4234.16s -> 4236.16s]  And Manchester City clear
[4236.16s -> 4239.16s]  Norwich when they do go forward though, they've got Man City worried
[4239.16s -> 4242.16s]  3-1 Norwich lead, Gabriel Jesus hits the ball out towards the right-hand side
[4242.16s -> 4246.16s]  It will stay in play, Kyle Walker sent very wide in order to keep it in
[4246.16s -> 4248.16s]  He's given the ball to Kevin De Bruyne
[4248.16s -> 4250.16s]  Now it's Sterling on the right wing
[4250.16s -> 4252.16s]  Walker's made the run forward and he cuts it back
[4252.16s -> 4255.16s]  And Ben Godfrey blocks and it's behind for another Manchester City corner
[4255.16s -> 4257.16s]  More applause at Carrow Road
[4257.16s -> 4259.16s]  Almost halfway through the second half
[4259.16s -> 4263.16s]  Norwich City 3, Manchester City 1 is the extraordinary scoreline
[4263.16s -> 4266.16s]  That we're bringing you on BBC Radio Norfolk this evening
[4266.16s -> 4268.16s]  I mentioned the high press game, Man City are playing now
[4268.16s -> 4271.16s]  Because they have to, it did open up another chance for Norwich City
[4271.16s -> 4273.16s]  It's a counter-attack which they did
[4273.16s -> 4275.16s]  However, it's swinging the other way now, a corner
[4277.16s -> 4279.16s]  De Bruyne from the right-hand side delivers
[4279.16s -> 4283.16s]  Ottomendi's header, oh, and Krul got his body in the way and did enough
[4283.16s -> 4286.16s]  There was almost a touch in front of him, Aguero was in there, Sterling was in there
[4286.16s -> 4288.16s]  But Tim Krul gathers
[4289.16s -> 4291.16s]  Well done Tim Krul, well done defensively
[4291.16s -> 4293.16s]  It was a clear-cut header
[4293.16s -> 4295.16s]  He got the ball on target
[4295.16s -> 4298.16s]  But it didn't really trouble Tim because it came straight at him
[4299.16s -> 4303.16s]  Ottomendi's first Manchester City goal back in 2015 was against Norwich
[4304.16s -> 4308.16s]  Alex Nialira went, Norwich were beaten 2-1 at the Atihad
[4309.16s -> 4311.16s]  Now for Steeperman, a Norwich attack
[4311.16s -> 4315.16s]  Steeperman works it to the left-hand side, knowing instinctively where Todd Cantwell would be
[4315.16s -> 4318.16s]  Lewis behind him, back again to Cantwell
[4318.16s -> 4320.16s]  Lewis again
[4320.16s -> 4323.16s]  Now McLean and the ball is passed all the way back to Ben Godfrey
[4323.16s -> 4326.16s]  On halfway, Godfrey though, driving the ball forward, it's cut out
[4326.16s -> 4329.16s]  The ball is missed the challenge, and Norwich have continued possession too easily
[4329.16s -> 4331.16s]  And here comes Raheem Sterling, running at Norwich City
[4331.16s -> 4333.16s]  Amadou with an important tackle, but it's not away yet
[4333.16s -> 4335.16s]  Here's Bernardo Silva, no, he's off balance
[4335.16s -> 4338.16s]  And Guendia has possession, and then backheels the ball into his own area
[4338.16s -> 4340.16s]  Allowing Amadou to clear
[4340.16s -> 4344.16s]  Hearts in mouths, 10 stuff at Carrow Road, magnificent stuff at Carrow Road
[4344.16s -> 4346.16s]  What a match this is, what a night this is
[4346.16s -> 4350.16s]  Guendia turns away from trouble, and has his heels clipped by Bernardo Silva
[4352.16s -> 4355.16s]  And the yellow card is going to come out for the Portugues player here
[4355.16s -> 4360.16s]  For some say could take over from Cristiano Ronaldo, the most important player in the Portugal team in years to come
[4360.16s -> 4365.16s]  Well, in his younger days, Ronaldo was beaten here at Carrow Road as a Manchester United player
[4365.16s -> 4371.16s]  Godfrey just sprinted 10 yards to grab hold of Amadou and hug him and high-five him for that brilliant interception
[4371.16s -> 4377.16s]  It was a crucial interception as well, Man City odds on to get a shot on target
[4377.16s -> 4379.16s]  The two centre-halves are strong-strong
[4379.16s -> 4382.16s]  The noise at Carrow Road is spine-tingling
[4382.16s -> 4386.16s]  The Orange fans know that they're witnessing something potentially very, very special here
[4386.16s -> 4388.16s]  Amadou might have undercut to back pass
[4388.16s -> 4390.16s]  Cruel Alert gets there before Gabriel Jesus
[4391.16s -> 4394.16s]  Here's Cantwell, goes down, no foul
[4394.16s -> 4398.16s]  Manchester City in search of a way back into this game
[4398.16s -> 4400.16s]  Raheem Sterling to De Bruyne
[4400.16s -> 4403.16s]  De Bruyne on the edge of the penalty area, what a block from Kenny McLean
[4403.16s -> 4405.16s]  And the ball rolls for Cantwell
[4405.16s -> 4410.16s]  And Cantwell with his hair tied back, brings the ball forward, on to Jamal Lewis
[4410.16s -> 4413.16s]  Lewis tackled by Walker, and now it goes for Maurice Dryad
[4413.16s -> 4416.16s]  And they've got a chance here to wind the clock down
[4416.16s -> 4419.16s]  I think we might hear back some Riyad Mahrez coming on
[4419.16s -> 4423.16s]  Yes, another Manchester City sub, a two-time Premier League champion
[4425.16s -> 4428.16s]  With Leicester, of course, and with Manchester City
[4428.16s -> 4432.16s]  He's going to have 20 minutes if he comes on now, which he's not going to
[4432.16s -> 4434.16s]  To try and help them back into the game
[4434.16s -> 4437.16s]  McLean picks the ball towards Byron, who takes that almost in his stripe
[4437.16s -> 4440.16s]  But Zinchenko is there to take it away from his toes
[4442.16s -> 4444.16s]  It's 3-1 to Norwich City
[4444.16s -> 4446.16s]  Here comes Manchester City goal, Bernardo Silva
[4446.16s -> 4450.16s]  Brandeis dropped into that right back position, filling in for Byron
[4451.16s -> 4453.16s]  Bernardo Silva gets the better of him
[4453.16s -> 4456.16s]  The ball comes to Rodri and then Zinchenko who plays it in field to Aguero
[4456.16s -> 4459.16s]  Poor touch from him, Byron's found Puky
[4459.16s -> 4462.16s]  And Zinchenko has been leaded to the floor by Rodri
[4462.16s -> 4464.16s]  And that will be a Norwich free kick and another chance just to relieve the pressure
[4464.16s -> 4467.16s]  20 minutes to play, Canary Call coming up at full time
[4468.16s -> 4471.16s]  Bernardo Silva has worked his socks off all game and especially there
[4471.16s -> 4475.16s]  He's such an important player down this right-hand side
[4475.16s -> 4480.16s]  Covering Sam Byron, following runners, tracking back, tackling
[4480.16s -> 4485.16s]  I'm sure the flamboyancy on the ball when he can go, when he's in space
[4485.16s -> 4488.16s]  And he has done today, he's looked an excellent player as always
[4488.16s -> 4490.16s]  But defensively I think he's been brilliant today
[4491.16s -> 4493.16s]  Norwich City 3, Manchester City 1
[4494.16s -> 4497.16s]  Listen to the crowd, they know what they're seeing here
[4497.16s -> 4500.16s]  They know how special this is for the Canaries
[4501.16s -> 4503.16s]  Free kick, Tim Kroll spots the run of Puky
[4503.16s -> 4505.16s]  He's gone out towards the left-hand side
[4505.16s -> 4507.16s]  And will go shoulder to shoulder with Kyle Walken
[4507.16s -> 4509.16s]  Either of them get the ball originally
[4509.16s -> 4511.16s]  And then Walken's able to chop it away towards the halfway line
[4511.16s -> 4514.16s]  It bounces awkwardly for Lewis who's under pressure from Gabriel Jesus
[4514.16s -> 4516.16s]  But he's got it back to Ben Godfrey
[4516.16s -> 4521.16s]  And now here's Abraham Amadou who could well be having a Carreiro debut to remember
[4522.16s -> 4525.16s]  It's an emergency centre-back, Byron onto Marko Stieperman
[4525.16s -> 4528.16s]  Stieperman turns, gets the ball to Gwendija here
[4528.16s -> 4530.16s]  25 yards out, Norwich on the attack here
[4530.16s -> 4533.16s]  Gwendija scoops it to Puky, Puky's in the area to the left of goal
[4533.16s -> 4535.16s]  Can he cut the ball back? He can
[4535.16s -> 4538.16s]  Gwendija just couldn't quite get the ball out of his feet to begin with
[4538.16s -> 4540.16s]  And then he's tackled by De Bruyne
[4540.16s -> 4542.16s]  But Norwich has got a chance to keep the pressure on here
[4542.16s -> 4544.16s]  With a brilliant Byron who's been sent to the floor
[4544.16s -> 4546.16s]  And it's a free kick
[4546.16s -> 4548.16s]  Foul on Sam Byron
[4549.16s -> 4552.16s]  What a debut in terms of a first start for him as well
[4552.16s -> 4556.16s]  He came on briefly as a sub against Newcastle in the Premier League
[4556.16s -> 4558.16s]  In the previous game that Norwich won
[4558.16s -> 4560.16s]  And now Stieperman is roaring at the bar
[4560.16s -> 4562.16s]  He's urging them to keep the noise levels up
[4562.16s -> 4566.16s]  18 minutes to go, Norwich City 3, Manchester City 1
[4566.16s -> 4570.16s]  Outstanding, Byron and Amadou, outstanding
[4570.16s -> 4572.16s]  Normally defensive duties I keep talking about
[4572.16s -> 4574.16s]  But then the attack in third
[4574.16s -> 4577.16s]  They were closing and pressing and running and chasing and squeezing
[4577.16s -> 4579.16s]  And they're doing incredibly well for Norwich
[4579.16s -> 4581.16s]  And now we've won this free kick
[4581.16s -> 4583.16s]  Too far out for a shot, I would have thought
[4583.16s -> 4585.16s]  What is it, 30, 35 yards?
[4585.16s -> 4587.16s]  Dead centre?
[4587.16s -> 4589.16s]  I'd say that's all of that, but why not?
[4589.16s -> 4591.16s]  Let's test the keeper, let's see what happens
[4591.16s -> 4593.16s]  It's our day, isn't it?
[4593.16s -> 4595.16s]  If this goes in, it is
[4595.16s -> 4597.16s]  McLean and Gwendija standing over the wall
[4597.16s -> 4601.16s]  Ederson standing slightly to the right of his centre of his goal
[4601.16s -> 4603.16s]  And Mbembe might fancy this
[4603.16s -> 4606.16s]  He takes the shot on and it skims along the ground and wide
[4606.16s -> 4608.16s]  Told you it was too far out, Gossie
[4608.16s -> 4611.16s]  No, I think it was definitely a shooting opportunity
[4611.16s -> 4613.16s]  I think he could have just hit the target
[4613.16s -> 4615.16s]  That's all, I made the keeper make a save
[4615.16s -> 4617.16s]  He's pulling his shorts up in anger and frustration
[4617.16s -> 4619.16s]  That he didn't hit it cleaner
[4619.16s -> 4621.16s]  Bernardo Silva has gone off
[4621.16s -> 4623.16s]  And Mares has come on
[4623.16s -> 4625.16s]  And they're making use of that new law here
[4625.16s -> 4627.16s]  Where the players have to go off on the nearest side of the pitch
[4627.16s -> 4630.16s]  So he's gone off by the Man City fans
[4630.16s -> 4632.16s]  And on will come Riyad Mares
[4632.16s -> 4634.16s]  The Algerian
[4634.16s -> 4636.16s]  With his team
[4636.16s -> 4638.16s]  Trailing at Carrow Road by 3 goals to 1
[4638.16s -> 4640.16s]  And 17 minutes left
[4640.16s -> 4642.16s]  Inchenko hits the ball out towards the right hand side
[4642.16s -> 4644.16s]  Tackle comes in from Janal Lewis on
[4644.16s -> 4647.16s]  Mares, and it's gone out of play for a throw into Norwich City
[4647.16s -> 4650.16s]  And that's it, his form has been so good
[4650.16s -> 4652.16s]  4 league titles since 2012
[4652.16s -> 4654.16s]  They've won the last 2
[4654.16s -> 4656.16s]  They've won the last 9 away games
[4656.16s -> 4658.16s]  They've scored 5 or more 11 times in the last year
[4658.16s -> 4662.16s]  And yet they find themselves 3-1 down at Carrow Road
[4662.16s -> 4664.16s]  With 16 minutes or so to go
[4664.16s -> 4666.16s]  Lewis gets the ball back to Godfrey
[4666.16s -> 4668.16s]  He clears his lines
[4668.16s -> 4670.16s]  Stones returns it
[4670.16s -> 4672.16s]  McClean controls
[4672.16s -> 4674.16s]  Gives it to Jamal Lewis
[4674.16s -> 4676.16s]  Lewis works the ball away
[4676.16s -> 4678.16s]  Pukki sends the opportunity for a moment
[4678.16s -> 4680.16s]  Ottomendi has come at the head of straight out of play for a Norwich throw in
[4680.16s -> 4684.16s]  This goes to prove you could never underestimate Norwich City here at Carrow Road
[4684.16s -> 4686.16s]  With the atmosphere the fans are creating
[4686.16s -> 4688.16s]  The skill of the players
[4688.16s -> 4690.16s]  The heart and design
[4690.16s -> 4692.16s]  The passion of the players that are on show
[4692.16s -> 4694.16s]  Here's Gwendolyn away from two challenges
[4694.16s -> 4696.16s]  And coming forward here
[4696.16s -> 4698.16s]  And he's got the ball towards Cantwell on the left
[4698.16s -> 4700.16s]  Cantwell has managed to turn it onto Gwendolyn
[4700.16s -> 4702.16s]  On the left wing they're linking up brilliantly
[4702.16s -> 4704.16s]  Gwendolyn back to Cantwell who almost gets himself into the penalty area
[4704.16s -> 4706.16s]  But John Stones is only just too strong
[4706.16s -> 4708.16s]  But Gwendolyn's blocked tackle, nearly falls for Pukki
[4708.16s -> 4710.16s]  And Ottomendi has to...
[4710.16s -> 4712.16s]  Another panicky flash and put the ball out into the stands for a throw in
[4712.16s -> 4714.16s]  It's getting noisier and noisier here
[4714.16s -> 4716.16s]  I've just seen one of the Norwich coaches
[4716.16s -> 4718.16s]  Or medical staff or somebody
[4718.16s -> 4720.16s]  Go out and tell one of the substitutes perhaps to get ready
[4720.16s -> 4722.16s]  Let's see
[4722.16s -> 4724.16s]  There's Stieperman
[4724.16s -> 4726.16s]  Turns the ball onto Cantwell
[4726.16s -> 4728.16s]  Back towards Stieperman
[4728.16s -> 4730.16s]  Kyle Walker's got the better of it
[4730.16s -> 4732.16s]  The ball comes to Sterling on halfway
[4732.16s -> 4734.16s]  He hits it forward early, De Bruyne has made the run
[4734.16s -> 4736.16s]  De Bruyne beats him to it, Teti collects the ball after a nice header from Sam Byron
[4736.16s -> 4738.16s]  And then gives it back to the Norwich right back
[4738.16s -> 4740.16s]  On the right wing
[4740.16s -> 4742.16s]  Up to Pukki
[4742.16s -> 4744.16s]  He's got it back to Byron
[4744.16s -> 4746.16s]  Byron was second favourite for that ball against Sterling you know
[4746.16s -> 4748.16s]  And it's passing over
[4748.16s -> 4750.16s]  15 to go
[4750.16s -> 4752.16s]  Norwich 3, Manchester City 1
[4752.16s -> 4754.16s]  And if you're a Norwich fan you will live every one of these 15 minutes
[4754.16s -> 4756.16s]  You really, really will
[4756.16s -> 4758.16s]  Amadou plays it forward
[4758.16s -> 4760.16s]  The ball bounces down for Alexander Teti
[4760.16s -> 4762.16s]  Harrow Road crowd again playing their part
[4766.16s -> 4768.16s]  Amadou, infield to Teti
[4770.16s -> 4772.16s]  Teti back to McLean
[4772.16s -> 4774.16s]  And McLean calmly
[4774.16s -> 4776.16s]  And confidently plays the ball
[4776.16s -> 4778.16s]  To Lewis on the left hand side
[4778.16s -> 4780.16s]  And they've got it back to Jamal Lewis, good play from Buendia
[4780.16s -> 4782.16s]  Lewis scampers forward
[4782.16s -> 4784.16s]  Goes down on the challenge of Walker
[4784.16s -> 4786.16s]  And referee, Kevin Friend rewards Norwich City
[4786.16s -> 4788.16s]  A free kick, Pep Guardiola
[4788.16s -> 4790.16s]  Animated that beige jumper again
[4790.16s -> 4792.16s]  Going in all directions on the side of the pitch
[4792.16s -> 4794.16s]  As he waves his arms about
[4794.16s -> 4796.16s]  To get messages across to his team
[4796.16s -> 4798.16s]  You just feel the belief
[4798.16s -> 4800.16s]  In the players now can't you
[4800.16s -> 4802.16s]  I've mentioned many of the Norwich City team and players today
[4802.16s -> 4804.16s]  And their great performance
[4804.16s -> 4806.16s]  But Teti then has had a really, really good spell
[4806.16s -> 4808.16s]  Of just keeping the ball and passing it
[4808.16s -> 4810.16s]  To a yellow shirt
[4810.16s -> 4812.16s]  And they're actually, dare I say, making Man City
[4812.16s -> 4814.16s]  Chase the ball
[4814.16s -> 4816.16s]  Here's Steeperman for Norwich City
[4816.16s -> 4818.16s]  Cutting into the penalty area from the left hand side
[4818.16s -> 4820.16s]  And he's gone a long way with it here, Marco Steeperman
[4820.16s -> 4822.16s]  In the end he's shut down by Stones, but he's still got the ball
[4822.16s -> 4824.16s]  Now they've managed to just get it away from him
[4824.16s -> 4826.16s]  Somehow in Manchester City, cleared
[4826.16s -> 4828.16s]  But a deflection has made it pull kindly for McLean
[4828.16s -> 4830.16s]  Tapuki in the penalty area just couldn't quite
[4830.16s -> 4832.16s]  Turn the ball past Ottomendi
[4832.16s -> 4834.16s]  And Man City bring it away
[4834.16s -> 4836.16s]  It's a belief on the pitch
[4836.16s -> 4838.16s]  There's still a sense of disbelief off the pitch in the stands
[4838.16s -> 4840.16s]  From the Norwich City fans
[4840.16s -> 4842.16s]  As Ben Goldberg gets the better of Gabriel Jesus
[4842.16s -> 4844.16s]  And then goes back to goalkeeper Krul
[4844.16s -> 4846.16s]  Who clears that ball away
[4846.16s -> 4848.16s]  Zinchenko still being booed
[4848.16s -> 4850.16s]  We know he's going to play the full 90 minutes now
[4850.16s -> 4852.16s]  Unless he gets sent off because
[4852.16s -> 4854.16s]  They've made the three subs
[4854.16s -> 4856.16s]  John Stones now coming forward
[4856.16s -> 4858.16s]  Ball at his feet from Manchester City
[4858.16s -> 4860.16s]  And within 25 yards of the Norwich goal
[4860.16s -> 4862.16s]  And he's fed Sterling, left corner of the penalty area
[4862.16s -> 4864.16s]  Raheem Sterling's cross and Guero's header over the bar
[4864.16s -> 4866.16s]  That's twice he's done that in this game
[4866.16s -> 4868.16s]  He has scored a goal, but he's also headed
[4868.16s -> 4870.16s]  Two chances over the bar
[4870.16s -> 4872.16s]  And we've got 13 minutes to go
[4872.16s -> 4874.16s]  And Norwich City could be on their way
[4874.16s -> 4876.16s]  To what would be one of the most famous
[4876.16s -> 4878.16s]  Premier League victories, not just here
[4878.16s -> 4880.16s]  But given the circumstances, I think anywhere
[4880.16s -> 4882.16s]  In the Premier League history, and that is not
[4882.16s -> 4884.16s]  Overstating it
[4884.16s -> 4886.16s]  No it's not, no absolutely agree with everything you say
[4886.16s -> 4888.16s]  Incredible result as we look at it today
[4888.16s -> 4890.16s]  We've just got another injury here
[4890.16s -> 4892.16s]  Gossie which should just break off, it's Gwendia down in the end of his own box
[4894.16s -> 4896.16s]  This will give people time to recover
[4896.16s -> 4898.16s]  Give players time to get some drink inside them
[4898.16s -> 4900.16s]  Causing the game with an injury
[4900.16s -> 4902.16s]  But wow how this Norwich back four
[4902.16s -> 4904.16s]  Performed, stopping crosses coming into the box
[4904.16s -> 4906.16s]  Forcing everything wide
[4906.16s -> 4908.16s]  And when it does come centrally
[4908.16s -> 4910.16s]  Ben Godfrey, Amadou outstanding
[4910.16s -> 4912.16s]  Jamal Lewis closing brilliantly
[4912.16s -> 4914.16s]  Sam Myron
[4914.16s -> 4916.16s]  Fantastic in his opportunity that's been given to him today
[4916.16s -> 4918.16s]  Teddy McLean
[4918.16s -> 4920.16s]  You can name all of them
[4920.16s -> 4922.16s]  They've collectively worked their socks off
[4922.16s -> 4924.16s]  And they've literally stopped this Man City team playing
[4924.16s -> 4926.16s]  Playing around them or playing through them
[4926.16s -> 4928.16s]  They've gone ahead and scored their goals
[4928.16s -> 4930.16s]  In Norwich City, they've stolen a couple
[4930.16s -> 4932.16s]  They've gifted one
[4932.16s -> 4934.16s]  It doesn't matter, they're up
[4934.16s -> 4936.16s]  And we'll take that gift
[4936.16s -> 4938.16s]  They've just got to hold on Chris
[4938.16s -> 4940.16s]  And it will be a great game
[4940.16s -> 4942.16s]  And we'll see what happens
[4942.16s -> 4944.16s]  They've just got to hold on Chris
[4944.16s -> 4946.16s]  And it will be one famous victory here at Carroll Road
[4946.16s -> 4948.16s]  They're taking Wendier off
[4948.16s -> 4950.16s]  It's been a great game today
[4950.16s -> 4952.16s]  He's had a brilliant game
[4952.16s -> 4954.16s]  And I would have thought that's only through exhaustion
[4954.16s -> 4956.16s]  And it'll have to do
[4956.16s -> 4958.16s]  I should have learnt by now with Daniel Falk
[4958.16s -> 4960.16s]  I was saying earlier on
[4960.16s -> 4962.16s]  Maybe they should bring on
[4962.16s -> 4964.16s]  Well actually they want to come back on Wendier
[4964.16s -> 4966.16s]  But they've got Josip Dermic ready to come on
[4966.16s -> 4968.16s]  The striker
[4968.16s -> 4970.16s]  And Wendier wants to rejoin proceedings
[4970.16s -> 4972.16s]  They've got two players waiting to come on
[4972.16s -> 4974.16s]  Here's Jamal Lewis on the left hand side
[4974.16s -> 4976.16s]  Lewis sending it forward to Stieperman
[4976.16s -> 4978.16s]  There's a break on for Norwich, even with a man short
[4978.16s -> 4980.16s]  And it's set Stieperman onto Pukki
[4980.16s -> 4982.16s]  Oh, Pukki caught by Kyle Walker there
[4982.16s -> 4984.16s]  Right on the edge of the box, corner of the area really
[4984.16s -> 4986.16s]  And Pukki's down
[4986.16s -> 4988.16s]  And Kyle Walker will be penalised
[4988.16s -> 4990.16s]  It's a free kick, so what are Norwich going to do here?
[4990.16s -> 4992.16s]  I was sure Wendier was going to come off
[4992.16s -> 4994.16s]  Because he's been led away by the physio
[4994.16s -> 4996.16s]  And Dermic is going to come on
[4996.16s -> 4998.16s]  As we see
[4998.16s -> 5000.16s]  A replay, that's a clear foul by Kyle Walker
[5002.16s -> 5004.16s]  What an opportunity Norwich have got here
[5004.16s -> 5006.16s]  A free kick, corner of the penalty area
[5006.16s -> 5008.16s]  Pukki and Stieperman are getting between the lines now
[5008.16s -> 5010.16s]  The space is opening up between the midfield
[5010.16s -> 5012.16s]  Man City, midfield and the back four
[5012.16s -> 5014.16s]  Both of them finding themselves in space
[5014.16s -> 5016.16s]  Pukki on that particular occasion
[5016.16s -> 5018.16s]  Received it, turned, run up Walker
[5018.16s -> 5020.16s]  And Walker's had a pretty poor game for me today
[5020.16s -> 5022.16s]  Could only just foul Pukki
[5022.16s -> 5024.16s]  To stop him in his tracks
[5024.16s -> 5026.16s]  Another good play by Stieperman
[5026.16s -> 5028.16s]  Another good position for Norwich by the way
[5028.16s -> 5030.16s]  Free kick Norwich, corner of the penalty area
[5030.16s -> 5032.16s]  Played into the Man City box
[5032.16s -> 5034.16s]  Too close to the keeper, Ederson who gets that
[5034.16s -> 5036.16s]  Already scored from one set piece today
[5036.16s -> 5038.16s]  Norwich the opener from Kenny McLean
[5038.16s -> 5040.16s]  If he'd gone for one up there in front of the Barclay
[5040.16s -> 5042.16s]  Well you would have heard
[5042.16s -> 5044.16s]  Noises that would have threatened the rick to scale I think
[5044.16s -> 5046.16s]  Still Dermich hasn't come on
[5048.16s -> 5050.16s]  And
[5050.16s -> 5052.16s]  Wendier's not moving particularly well
[5052.16s -> 5054.16s]  But he's stayed out there for now
[5054.16s -> 5056.16s]  What have we got? 10 minutes to go
[5056.16s -> 5058.16s]  Norwich City 3, Manchester City 1
[5058.16s -> 5060.16s]  At Carrow Road
[5060.16s -> 5062.16s]  Here's Zinchenko, onto Aguero
[5062.16s -> 5064.16s]  Back to Zinchenko who burst into the penalty area
[5064.16s -> 5066.16s]  And Byrom's managed to somehow play the ball
[5066.16s -> 5068.16s]  Between Sterling's legs and away
[5068.16s -> 5070.16s]  Campwell's clear and so it's hit
[5070.16s -> 5072.16s]  Team Pukki, they've gone out of play for a throw-out
[5076.16s -> 5078.16s]  10 minutes to play
[5078.16s -> 5080.16s]  Norwich City 3, Manchester City 1
[5080.16s -> 5082.16s]  And the ball is in the net
[5082.16s -> 5084.16s]  Manchester City 1
[5084.16s -> 5086.16s]  Here's Ottomendi now
[5086.16s -> 5088.16s]  Plays the ball inside to John Stones
[5088.16s -> 5090.16s]  Kyle Walken
[5090.16s -> 5092.16s]  Aims it towards the right wing
[5092.16s -> 5094.16s]  An opportunity here for
[5094.16s -> 5096.16s]  Mares to make something happen
[5096.16s -> 5098.16s]  Plays it in field to Stones
[5098.16s -> 5100.16s]  Now they try the luck on the left wing with Zinchenko
[5100.16s -> 5102.16s]  Sterling
[5102.16s -> 5104.16s]  Left edge of the penalty area for Manchester City
[5104.16s -> 5106.16s]  Still no great panic about the way
[5106.16s -> 5108.16s]  Manchester City are playing
[5108.16s -> 5110.16s]  They're working the ball forward carefully
[5110.16s -> 5112.16s]  On to Mares who now does deliver
[5112.16s -> 5114.16s]  And the header from Jesus
[5114.16s -> 5116.16s]  Deflected over the bar, corner
[5116.16s -> 5118.16s]  They're getting there successfully
[5118.16s -> 5120.16s]  These set pieces and these crosses Chris
[5120.16s -> 5122.16s]  Instead of Mares going down the right hand side
[5122.16s -> 5124.16s]  Crossing an out swinging ball with his right foot
[5124.16s -> 5126.16s]  He checks in and delivers an in
[5126.16s -> 5128.16s]  Swinger with his left
[5128.16s -> 5130.16s]  Same thing happened here
[5130.16s -> 5132.16s]  With Silva down the left hand flank just a moment ago
[5132.16s -> 5134.16s]  We had Mares with a corner on the right hand side
[5134.16s -> 5136.16s]  With the left foot, swings it into the Norwich penalty area
[5136.16s -> 5138.16s]  Now dangerously, Stiefenman I think
[5138.16s -> 5140.16s]  Just did enough, oh I'm sure
[5140.16s -> 5142.16s]  Stiefenman touched that one for a corner
[5142.16s -> 5144.16s]  But a goal kick's been given
[5144.16s -> 5146.16s]  It looked it didn't it but it will take it as a goal kick
[5146.16s -> 5148.16s]  And I think maybe a sub coming on now
[5148.16s -> 5150.16s]  Dermot can now come on for Buendia
[5150.16s -> 5152.16s]  And there was me earlier on talking about the possibility
[5152.16s -> 5154.16s]  Of bringing Grant Hanley on to shore it up
[5154.16s -> 5156.16s]  Not Daniel Tharko
[5156.16s -> 5158.16s]  Let's stick another striker Rob
[5158.16s -> 5160.16s]  Buendia has set up two of the goals today
[5160.16s -> 5162.16s]  His best performance in the Premier League so far
[5162.16s -> 5164.16s]  And he's applauded off
[5164.16s -> 5166.16s]  And no wonder by Cara Road, he's played his part
[5166.16s -> 5168.16s]  Not just the assists but that work rope from Buendia tonight
[5168.16s -> 5170.16s]  Absolutely, he showed the other side of his game today
[5170.16s -> 5172.16s]  He's been a team player defensively
[5172.16s -> 5174.16s]  Helping out
[5174.16s -> 5176.16s]  Running with runners
[5176.16s -> 5178.16s]  Tracking back defensively
[5178.16s -> 5180.16s]  Getting blocks in, closing down, pressing
[5180.16s -> 5182.16s]  And then when the opportunity comes
[5182.16s -> 5184.16s]  He can deliver and make assists
[5184.16s -> 5186.16s]  He's played really really well, deserved that applause
[5186.16s -> 5188.16s]  And there's Daniel Tharko
[5188.16s -> 5190.16s]  He doesn't change his methodology, it's just well
[5190.16s -> 5192.16s]  We've taken an attacking player off so we'll stick another one on
[5192.16s -> 5194.16s]  And Dermot's the Swiss striker, he's had his own injury problems this season
[5194.16s -> 5196.16s]  Limited to two brief substitute appearances so far
[5196.16s -> 5198.16s]  On he comes
[5198.16s -> 5200.16s]  But he'll have to work just as hard as Buendia was
[5200.16s -> 5202.16s]  And I'm sure that's what Daniel Tharko will have been telling him
[5202.16s -> 5204.16s]  Here's Walker, racing over the halfway line
[5204.16s -> 5206.16s]  With the ball from Manchester City
[5206.16s -> 5208.16s]  To the feet of Gabriel Jesus, back to goal
[5208.16s -> 5210.16s]  Finds Sterling on the left corner of the penalty area
[5210.16s -> 5212.16s]  He's skipped away from Dermich there
[5212.16s -> 5214.16s]  Sterling, Norwich have plenty back
[5214.16s -> 5216.16s]  Sterling's found a way into the penalty area
[5216.16s -> 5218.16s]  To Jesus, onto Aguero
[5218.16s -> 5220.16s]  It might fall here for Jesus, great tackle from Byron
[5220.16s -> 5222.16s]  Jesus has picked it up again on the edge of the sixth yard
[5222.16s -> 5224.16s]  It's so busy in there he can't get the shot away
[5224.16s -> 5226.16s]  And Norwich by sheer weight of numbers
[5226.16s -> 5228.16s]  Have smuggled that ball out of play for a throw in
[5228.16s -> 5230.16s]  Waiting for the shot to come in
[5230.16s -> 5232.16s]  He's trying to dribble that in the back of the net
[5232.16s -> 5234.16s]  Well done Norwich, come on, keep this defence going
[5234.16s -> 5236.16s]  Proper backs of the wall stuff as Man City come again
[5236.16s -> 5238.16s]  Mares moves inside
[5238.16s -> 5240.16s]  Great block from McClain
[5240.16s -> 5242.16s]  And Cantwell launches it away
[5242.16s -> 5244.16s]  And Edison, the Manchester City goalkeeper
[5244.16s -> 5246.16s]  Has just gathered possession on the right wing
[5246.16s -> 5248.16s]  Almost on the halfway line
[5248.16s -> 5250.16s]  And he's got the ball from the right side
[5250.16s -> 5252.16s]  Right wing, almost on the halfway line
[5252.16s -> 5254.16s]  Everyone back for Norwich City and you can understand it
[5254.16s -> 5256.16s]  Daniel Fokker doesn't like parking the bus
[5256.16s -> 5258.16s]  But if there ever was a time to do it
[5258.16s -> 5260.16s]  Six and a half minutes to go
[5260.16s -> 5262.16s]  And they're 3-1 up against Manchester City at home
[5264.16s -> 5266.16s]  Here's De Bruyne, to Zinchenko on the left hand side
[5266.16s -> 5268.16s]  Zinchenko again
[5268.16s -> 5270.16s]  Gives the ball to Stones
[5270.16s -> 5272.16s]  Forward comes John Stones
[5274.16s -> 5276.16s]  25 yards out
[5276.16s -> 5278.16s]  Plays the ball right hand side
[5278.16s -> 5280.16s]  Now Kyle Walker to De Bruyne
[5280.16s -> 5282.16s]  Who's 30 yards out
[5282.16s -> 5284.16s]  Pulling the strings, finding Sterling on the left hand side
[5284.16s -> 5286.16s]  Curling from Sterling
[5286.16s -> 5288.16s]  And beyond everybody, from behind for a goal kick
[5288.16s -> 5290.16s]  And Steedman collapses to the floor
[5292.16s -> 5294.16s]  Saying that he needs a bit of help with Cramp
[5294.16s -> 5296.16s]  And he's getting help on one leg from Teti
[5296.16s -> 5298.16s]  And on the other leg from Roderick
[5298.16s -> 5300.16s]  The Manchester City player
[5300.16s -> 5302.16s]  This is something isn't it Gossie
[5302.16s -> 5304.16s]  Let's just take a moment to appreciate this
[5304.16s -> 5306.16s]  Absolutely, and we've got around about
[5306.16s -> 5308.16s]  10 minutes more of sheer effort
[5308.16s -> 5310.16s]  And determination and will and desire
[5310.16s -> 5312.16s]  Left in this particular game
[5312.16s -> 5314.16s]  Left for every single player
[5314.16s -> 5316.16s]  And for a player to go down of his stature
[5316.16s -> 5318.16s]  With Cramp goes to show you just how much work he's putting into it
[5318.16s -> 5320.16s]  But that's going for every single player
[5320.16s -> 5322.16s]  But they're still solid
[5322.16s -> 5324.16s]  They're still focused, they're still concentrating
[5324.16s -> 5326.16s]  They've got such little time to hold out now
[5326.16s -> 5328.16s]  They really must hang on
[5328.16s -> 5330.16s]  Dennis Shrubbini is going to come on in a moment
[5330.16s -> 5332.16s]  That must be a reaction to
[5332.16s -> 5334.16s]  I think Steedman perhaps running out of energy
[5334.16s -> 5336.16s]  Or Pukki maybe
[5336.16s -> 5338.16s]  Let's see
[5338.16s -> 5340.16s]  Pukki's got his goal today
[5340.16s -> 5342.16s]  3-1 Norwich lead
[5342.16s -> 5344.16s]  5 minutes to go
[5346.16s -> 5348.16s]  Here's Stones
[5348.16s -> 5350.16s]  5 minutes past stoppage time I should add
[5350.16s -> 5352.16s]  Stones, Pukki has given up the chase for once
[5352.16s -> 5354.16s]  And has allowed Stones to hit the ball towards Sterling
[5354.16s -> 5356.16s]  Left edge of the penalty area
[5356.16s -> 5358.16s]  Raheem Sterling
[5358.16s -> 5360.16s]  Teasing Byram, getting into a central position
[5360.16s -> 5362.16s]  Raheem Sterling shot, big deflection
[5362.16s -> 5364.16s]  And the header taken comfortably by Tim Krul
[5364.16s -> 5366.16s]  Still 3-1
[5368.16s -> 5370.16s]  Well done, showed Sterling inside
[5370.16s -> 5372.16s]  Go down on the outside because he's dangerous
[5372.16s -> 5374.16s]  You show him inside where the yellow shirts are
[5374.16s -> 5376.16s]  Where your numbers are, that's exactly what he did there
[5376.16s -> 5378.16s]  Got the shot away
[5378.16s -> 5380.16s]  Ricocheted, ends up in Krul's hand
[5380.16s -> 5382.16s]  All is safe
[5382.16s -> 5384.16s]  Big boot from Tim Krul and it's going to go straight through to Edison
[5384.16s -> 5386.16s]  Well it would have done, but Ottomendi has thought
[5386.16s -> 5388.16s]  No we can't even afford that extra 10 seconds
[5388.16s -> 5390.16s]  We need to get the ball going again
[5390.16s -> 5392.16s]  And here they come
[5392.16s -> 5394.16s]  The pacey Kyle Walker still full of running
[5394.16s -> 5396.16s]  All-Campwell makes a challenge
[5396.16s -> 5398.16s]  And maybe
[5398.16s -> 5400.16s]  Missed on that and the free kick
[5400.16s -> 5402.16s]  Has been given and the yellow card is coming out for Todd
[5402.16s -> 5404.16s]  Campwell who just thought he could get something on that
[5404.16s -> 5406.16s]  As Walker broke away
[5406.16s -> 5408.16s]  He's been shown the yellow card, third Norwich players go in the book
[5410.16s -> 5412.16s]  Yeah it was a foul
[5412.16s -> 5414.16s]  Yeah, he
[5414.16s -> 5416.16s]  Desperation to contribute and get that
[5416.16s -> 5418.16s]  Tackling, stop him driving forward
[5418.16s -> 5420.16s]  He's lunged in with his right foot
[5420.16s -> 5422.16s]  Walk around the ankles, it was a definite foul
[5422.16s -> 5424.16s]  And that's the right word for it, it was a lunge
[5424.16s -> 5426.16s]  And now a free kick and then city
[5426.16s -> 5428.16s]  Right wing
[5428.16s -> 5430.16s]  It's played in by De Bruyne
[5430.16s -> 5432.16s]  Punched by Krul, he's done enough
[5432.16s -> 5434.16s]  He's done enough for now
[5434.16s -> 5436.16s]  Norwich need to reset because Sterling has gathered
[5436.16s -> 5438.16s]  The ball on the left hand side
[5438.16s -> 5440.16s]  Raheem Sterling on his right foot
[5440.16s -> 5442.16s]  Gets the cross in dangerously
[5442.16s -> 5444.16s]  Towards the far post and back across goal from Aguero
[5444.16s -> 5446.16s]  And turned over brilliantly by Tim Krul
[5446.16s -> 5450.16s]  That's a great save because I think most people thought that ball was going to curl behind for a goal kick
[5450.16s -> 5452.16s]  But Aguero made something of it
[5452.16s -> 5454.16s]  And Krul has saved it very well
[5454.16s -> 5456.16s]  Terrific, terrific, everyone's playing their part
[5456.16s -> 5458.16s]  And Tim Krul's coming to his best now
[5458.16s -> 5460.16s]  Switch on, switch on, I thought he'd get a short corner there
[5460.16s -> 5462.16s]  Tenth time, three minutes to go
[5462.16s -> 5464.16s]  Plus stoppages, 3-1 to Norwich City
[5464.16s -> 5466.16s]  Against Manchester City
[5466.16s -> 5468.16s]  Mahrez corner, played in from the right
[5468.16s -> 5470.16s]  Headed on by Rodjery, scrambled away by Norwich City
[5470.16s -> 5472.16s]  But Zinchenko's going to hit one from distance
[5472.16s -> 5474.16s]  And it's blocked by Teti
[5474.16s -> 5476.16s]  The ball falls to Jesus on the edge of the penalty area
[5476.16s -> 5478.16s]  And the ball is going to bounce now for Sterling
[5478.16s -> 5480.16s]  Well forward on the left hand side
[5480.16s -> 5482.16s]  Everybody back for Norwich City
[5482.16s -> 5484.16s]  Jesus has got away from Dermich on the edge of the penalty area
[5484.16s -> 5486.16s]  Sets up Rodjery who will let fly into the net
[5486.16s -> 5488.16s]  Krul got a hand to it, couldn't keep it out
[5488.16s -> 5490.16s]  We've got some finish ahead of us now
[5490.16s -> 5492.16s]  Two and a half minutes to go plus stoppage time
[5492.16s -> 5494.16s]  It's Norwich City 3, Manchester City 2
[5494.16s -> 5496.16s]  Rodjery has his first goal for the champions
[5496.16s -> 5498.16s]  But all that's done is brought another roar out of the Cairo crowd
[5498.16s -> 5500.16s]  3-2 to the Canaries
[5500.16s -> 5502.16s]  Just worked it well around the area
[5502.16s -> 5504.16s]  Manchester City got it to the edge of the box
[5504.16s -> 5506.16s]  He was 25 yards out with a load of yellow shirts in front of him
[5506.16s -> 5508.16s]  But he struck it well
[5508.16s -> 5510.16s]  Bottom of Tim Krul, white hand pose
[5510.16s -> 5512.16s]  Just sneaked in
[5512.16s -> 5514.16s]  And I suppose in the end it was the only way they were going to score
[5514.16s -> 5516.16s]  Because they're trying to warp the ball in every time Manchester City
[5516.16s -> 5518.16s]  Or deliver from the red
[5518.16s -> 5520.16s]  It was a decent strike
[5520.16s -> 5522.16s]  Largely disappointed to concede
[5522.16s -> 5524.16s]  Can we hang on?
[5524.16s -> 5526.16s]  There must be about four minutes left surely
[5526.16s -> 5528.16s]  But it's a good start
[5528.16s -> 5530.16s]  There must be about four minutes left surely
[5530.16s -> 5532.16s]  We've got to hang on to this now
[5532.16s -> 5534.16s]  Because we fully deserve this victory
[5534.16s -> 5536.16s]  It's the substitution we were all anticipating
[5536.16s -> 5538.16s]  Steakman goes off as Trevenny comes on
[5538.16s -> 5540.16s]  Just to get someone with a little bit more energy
[5540.16s -> 5542.16s]  And a little bit of freshness out there
[5542.16s -> 5544.16s]  But this is the problem isn't it
[5544.16s -> 5546.16s]  As well as Norwich have done
[5546.16s -> 5548.16s]  The more that a team like Manchester City attack
[5548.16s -> 5550.16s]  They eventually find a way don't they
[5550.16s -> 5552.16s]  And that's without Norwich really doing much wrong
[5552.16s -> 5554.16s]  3-2
[5554.16s -> 5556.16s]  Tense, tense stuff at Cairo Road
[5556.16s -> 5559.16s]  Pukki is penalised for grappling with Rodri
[5559.16s -> 5561.16s]  Who takes the free kick quickly
[5561.16s -> 5563.16s]  And Manchester City know
[5563.16s -> 5565.16s]  They've got an opportunity now in this game
[5565.16s -> 5567.16s]  Here's Aguero, aims the ball out towards the right hand side
[5567.16s -> 5569.16s]  Mares gathers
[5569.16s -> 5571.16s]  Mares on the front foot against Jamal Lewis
[5571.16s -> 5573.16s]  Gets the cross in, Lewis makes the block
[5573.16s -> 5575.16s]  It's a Manchester City corner
[5575.16s -> 5578.16s]  Mares is a sharp, quick, very skillful player
[5578.16s -> 5580.16s]  He's stuck with him
[5580.16s -> 5582.16s]  Stopped the cross coming in, did exactly what his job should be
[5582.16s -> 5584.16s]  He did really, really well there
[5585.16s -> 5587.16s]  Corner
[5587.16s -> 5589.16s]  To Manchester, who've just got back into this game
[5589.16s -> 5591.16s]  3-2, we're in the 90th minute
[5591.16s -> 5593.16s]  Dobroina's corner
[5593.16s -> 5595.16s]  Should be headed away by Godfrey and here's Pukki
[5595.16s -> 5597.16s]  Whacks the ball further upfield
[5597.16s -> 5599.16s]  Edison, the goalkeeper
[5599.16s -> 5601.16s]  Is on the halfway line for Manchester City
[5601.16s -> 5603.16s]  He's good with his feet, but he plays this one short
[5603.16s -> 5605.16s]  To Zinchenko
[5605.16s -> 5607.16s]  Ukrainian international
[5607.16s -> 5609.16s]  Plays it inside to Kyle Walker
[5609.16s -> 5611.16s]  Even Pukki looks too tired to give chase there
[5611.16s -> 5613.16s]  Here comes Dobroina
[5613.16s -> 5615.16s]  In the Norwich penalty area for Dobroina to try and hit
[5615.16s -> 5617.16s]  He's headed down
[5617.16s -> 5619.16s]  There for Sterling in the box
[5619.16s -> 5621.16s]  Won't quite run for Jesus, it's gone behind
[5621.16s -> 5623.16s]  It came off a Norwich player last
[5623.16s -> 5625.16s]  It will be Manchester City's 15th corner of the evening
[5625.16s -> 5627.16s]  Norwich with more defending to do
[5627.16s -> 5629.16s]  We've got 10 seconds plus stoppage time
[5629.16s -> 5631.16s]  He dealt with a lot of these corners really well
[5631.16s -> 5633.16s]  Got to do it again now
[5633.16s -> 5635.16s]  Short corner
[5635.16s -> 5637.16s]  Dobroina finding Jesus
[5637.16s -> 5639.16s]  Back to Dobroina on the left hand side
[5639.16s -> 5641.16s]  It's played to Zinchenko on the edge of the box
[5641.16s -> 5643.16s]  Norwich has got it
[5643.16s -> 5645.16s]  And it's headed behind by Byron
[5645.16s -> 5647.16s]  Corner number 16 on the way
[5647.16s -> 5649.16s]  4 minutes of stoppage time
[5649.16s -> 5651.16s]  Norwich are 4 minutes away
[5651.16s -> 5653.16s]  For a famous victory, but they've got a lot of work to do still
[5653.16s -> 5655.16s]  They know it
[5655.16s -> 5657.16s]  Corner's been taken to Walker here
[5657.16s -> 5659.16s]  Walker bursts into the penalty area
[5659.16s -> 5661.16s]  Crosses, blocked by Kenny McLean
[5661.16s -> 5663.16s]  And launched
[5663.16s -> 5665.16s]  Into the Norfolk sky by Kenny McLean
[5665.16s -> 5667.16s]  Back they come
[5667.16s -> 5669.16s]  Norwich lead
[5669.16s -> 5671.16s]  And the ball out of play
[5671.16s -> 5673.16s]  The ball out of play for a throw in
[5673.16s -> 5675.16s]  It's a Manchester City throw
[5675.16s -> 5677.16s]  It's been taken by Zinchenko
[5677.16s -> 5679.16s]  Comes to Dobroina
[5679.16s -> 5681.16s]  Pep Guardiola pointing, urging his team forward here
[5681.16s -> 5683.16s]  In search of an equaliser
[5683.16s -> 5685.16s]  Here's Rodrik, who scored a moment ago
[5685.16s -> 5687.16s]  Canwell cuts that one out though
[5687.16s -> 5689.16s]  And again launches it
[5689.16s -> 5691.16s]  And Ederson the goalkeeper is almost up on the halfway line
[5691.16s -> 5693.16s]  But Norwich are too tight to chase it down
[5693.16s -> 5695.16s]  He's on the line, he's on the line
[5695.16s -> 5697.16s]  He's on the line, he's on the line
[5697.16s -> 5699.16s]  He's on the line, he's on the line
[5699.16s -> 5701.16s]  He's on the line, he's on the line
[5701.16s -> 5703.16s]  Four minutes of stoppage time was signalled
[5703.16s -> 5705.16s]  We've had a minute of the stoppages
[5705.16s -> 5707.16s]  Here comes Dobroina again
[5707.16s -> 5709.16s]  It's a tackling defence at the moment
[5709.16s -> 5711.16s]  Aguero's got past Dermitch
[5711.16s -> 5713.16s]  Aguero's shot, Tim Croce
[5713.16s -> 5715.16s]  Your heart's in your mouth there
[5715.16s -> 5717.16s]  Aguero famous for some last minute heroics in the Premier League
[5717.16s -> 5719.16s]  A typical turn, a twist
[5719.16s -> 5721.16s]  A dribble in the box
[5721.16s -> 5723.16s]  And a great opportunity to score and shoot
[5723.16s -> 5725.16s]  He did all of them well
[5725.16s -> 5727.16s]  He did all of them well but he didn't expect him to make that save
[5727.16s -> 5729.16s]  Now Tim's just got to hold on to this for a while
[5729.16s -> 5731.16s]  And he will do
[5731.16s -> 5733.16s]  And with the left foot he'll launch the ball upfield
[5733.16s -> 5735.16s]  Oh, big kick
[5735.16s -> 5737.16s]  Stones, gets his head to it for Manchester City
[5737.16s -> 5739.16s]  Ottomendi, oh, heads it back to the goalkeeper
[5739.16s -> 5741.16s]  With Pukic sniffing
[5741.16s -> 5743.16s]  But he's got enough on it
[5743.16s -> 5745.16s]  So we've got
[5745.16s -> 5747.16s]  Two minutes and fifteen seconds
[5747.16s -> 5749.16s]  Of the stoppage time to go
[5749.16s -> 5751.16s]  The Carrow Road crowd that are whistling
[5751.16s -> 5753.16s]  That's too optimistic, there's plenty of football left in this year
[5753.16s -> 5755.16s]  3-2 to Norwich City
[5755.16s -> 5757.16s]  Here comes Manchester City
[5757.16s -> 5759.16s]  Here comes Zinchenko
[5759.16s -> 5761.16s]  Finds Sterling on this left hand side, the near side
[5761.16s -> 5763.16s]  Pushes it to the edge of the penalty area
[5763.16s -> 5765.16s]  Cross comes in, headed away by Norwich City
[5765.16s -> 5767.16s]  But it's come out to De Bruyne on this left hand side
[5767.16s -> 5769.16s]  Now Zinchenko
[5769.16s -> 5771.16s]  Now De Bruyne once more
[5771.16s -> 5773.16s]  Sterling in front of him, on the left
[5773.16s -> 5775.16s]  Brings it into the penalty area for Manchester City
[5775.16s -> 5777.16s]  Tees up Gabriel Jesus who's going to get the shot in
[5777.16s -> 5779.16s]  No good free blocks, shot comes in eventually
[5779.16s -> 5781.16s]  And Krul saves again
[5781.16s -> 5783.16s]  And Norwich have got 90 seconds to see this game out
[5783.16s -> 5785.16s]  And there are yellow shirts on the floor
[5785.16s -> 5787.16s]  They're dead on the feet
[5787.16s -> 5789.16s]  Because of the work they put into this game
[5789.16s -> 5791.16s]  Why is football sometimes worse
[5791.16s -> 5793.16s]  When your team is winning in stoppage time
[5793.16s -> 5795.16s]  That feeling, there's nothing quite like it
[5795.16s -> 5797.16s]  There really isn't
[5797.16s -> 5799.16s]  The tension
[5799.16s -> 5801.16s]  Grant Hanley may be about to come on
[5801.16s -> 5803.16s]  Norwich launch it long through Tim Krul
[5803.16s -> 5805.16s]  It's fallen for Rodri in the centre circle
[5805.16s -> 5807.16s]  Pukic!
[5807.16s -> 5809.16s]  Won't give him a moments piece but Rodri's too strong
[5809.16s -> 5811.16s]  He holds him off, he finds Aguero 30 yards from goal
[5811.16s -> 5813.16s]  Jamal Lewis with a heroic challenge there
[5813.16s -> 5815.16s]  To take it off Aguero
[5815.16s -> 5817.16s]  But Aguero recovers
[5817.16s -> 5819.16s]  Now Kompel goes looking for the ball
[5819.16s -> 5821.16s]  And the free kick has been taken quickly
[5821.16s -> 5823.16s]  And Norwich are under big pressure
[5823.16s -> 5825.16s]  It's played into the penalty area here
[5825.16s -> 5827.16s]  And it's Raheem Sterling for Manchester City
[5827.16s -> 5829.16s]  Gets the shot in, oh Krul saves it again
[5829.16s -> 5831.16s]  We're in the final minute of stoppage time
[5831.16s -> 5833.16s]  Norwich are 3-2 up
[5833.16s -> 5835.16s]  Daniel Barker is going crazy on the side of the pitch
[5835.16s -> 5837.16s]  He'd like to be out there the way he's whirling around
[5837.16s -> 5839.16s]  The stadium's going to erupt in a few minutes time
[5841.16s -> 5843.16s]  It's erupted already I know
[5845.16s -> 5847.16s]  Long kick from Tim Krul
[5847.16s -> 5849.16s]  Misjudged by Zinchenko
[5849.16s -> 5851.16s]  Trebene bearing down on the Man City penalty area
[5851.16s -> 5853.16s]  But he doesn't get the better of Ottomendi
[5853.16s -> 5855.16s]  Maybe Man City will have another chance
[5855.16s -> 5857.16s]  No!
[5857.16s -> 5859.16s]  Norwich has nicked it
[5859.16s -> 5861.16s]  25 yards from goal
[5861.16s -> 5863.16s]  Onto Todd Kompel now in the penalty area
[5863.16s -> 5865.16s]  But Kompel's only interested in that corner flag in front of the snake pit
[5865.16s -> 5867.16s]  Showing maturity and experience beyond his years here
[5867.16s -> 5869.16s]  Todd Kompel holding the ball in the corner flag
[5869.16s -> 5871.16s]  Eventually conceding to throw it
[5871.16s -> 5873.16s]  9 seconds of the stoppage time to go
[5877.16s -> 5879.16s]  Man City have it
[5879.16s -> 5881.16s]  They play it short to Jon Stone
[5881.16s -> 5883.16s]  Norwich putting him under pressure
[5883.16s -> 5885.16s]  Norwich have done it!
[5885.16s -> 5887.16s]  That is a wonderful Carrow Road night
[5887.16s -> 5889.16s]  A night to remember
[5889.16s -> 5891.16s]  It is one of the best results in Norwich City's history
[5891.16s -> 5893.16s]  It's probably one of the biggest surprises
[5893.16s -> 5895.16s]  In Premier League history
[5895.16s -> 5897.16s]  And that is not overstating it
[5897.16s -> 5899.16s]  Norwich City with an injury list as long as you're on
